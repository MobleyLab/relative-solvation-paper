Folder with statistical analysis on the final results

- inputdata :  csv files for unpertubed h bonds results of relative and absolute estimation
	       along with their standard errors

- outputdata:  outputfiles produced by confidence_interval.py and mue_calculator.py

- confidence_interval.py : script which takes as input absolute and relative values and compute
               r, r2, mue with 95% confidence, by bootstraping each relative estimations
               Usage: python confidence_interval.py  inputdata/absolute.csv inputdata/relative.csv
               Output:  errorbounds.dat

- mue_calculator.py : simple python script to compute MUE between rel and abs value
               Usage: python mue_calculator.py
               Output: mue_val.dat
