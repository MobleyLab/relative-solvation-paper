                  significant advantage of this method is that the
                  binding free energy is calculated using a single
                  reaction coordinate from a single simulation. This
                  has enabled the development of new visualisations of

                  of theoretical papers, few methods of computing
                  binding affinities are derived explicitly from this
                  underlying theory. This has contributed to
                  uncertainty and controversy in certain areas. This
                  article therefore reviews and extends the
                  connections of some important computational methods
                  with the underlying statistical thermodynamics. A
                  derivation of the standard free energy of binding
                  forms the basis of this review. This derivation
                  should be useful in formulating novel computational
                  methods for predicting binding affinities. It also
                  permits several important points to be
                  established. For example, it is found that the
                  double-annihilation method of computing binding
                  energy does not yield the standard free energy of
                  binding, but can be modified to yield this
                  quantity. The derivation also makes it possible to
                  define clearly the changes in translational,
                  rotational, configurational, and solvent entropy
                  upon binding. It is argued that molecular mass has a
                  negligible effect upon the standard free energy of
                  binding for biomolecular systems, and that the
                  cratic entropy defined by Gurney is not a useful
                  concept. In addition, the use of continuum models of
                  the solvent in binding calculations is reviewed, and
                  a formalism is presented for incorporating a limited
                  number of solvent molecules explicitly.",

                  particle with its surroundings is increased very
                  slowly. This singularity is analysed theoretically
                  for a liquid that interacts with the new particle
                  through a soft-sphere or a Lennard-Jones potential,
                  using a virial expansion of the free energy
                  derivative. For a soft-sphere potential u(r) =
                  lambda(alpha)Ar(-n) (where lambda is a coupling
                  constant), we show rigorously that the derivative of
                  the free energy with respect to lambda is infinite
                  at the origin if and only if alpha < n/3. This

                  in discovery projects have been relatively few,
                  partly because of the difficulty of planning and
                  setting up calculations. Here, we introduce lead
                  optimization mapper, LOMAP, an automated algorithm
                  to plan efficient relative free energy calculations
                  between potential ligands within a substantial
                  library of perhaps hundreds of compounds. In this
                  approach, ligands are first grouped by structural
                  similarity primarily based on the size of a (loosely
                  defined) maximal common substructure, and then
                  calculations are planned within and between sets of
                  structurally related compounds. An emphasis is
                  placed on ensuring that relative free energies can
                  be obtained between any pair of compounds without
                  combining the results of too many different relative
                  free energy calculations (to avoid accumulation of
                  error) and by providing some redundancy to allow for
                  the possibility of error and consistency checking
                  and provide some insight into when results can be
                  expected to be unreliable. The algorithm is

                  experimental and calculated hydration free energies
                  for small neutral molecules in water, along with
                  molecular structures, input files, references, and
                  annotations. We call this the Free Solvation
                  Database, or FreeSolv. Experimental values were
                  taken from prior literature and will continue to be
                  curated, with updated experimental references and
                  data added as they become available. Calculated
                  values are based on alchemical free energy
                  calculations using molecular dynamics
                  simulations. These used the GAFF small molecule
                  force field in TIP3P water with AM1-BCC
                  charges. Values were calculated with the GROMACS
                  simulation package, with full details given in
                  references cited within the database itself. This
                  database builds in part on a previous, 504-molecule
                  database containing similar information. However,
                  additional curation of both experimental data and
                  calculated values has been done here, and the total
                  number of molecules is now up to 643. Additional
                  information is now included in the database, such as
                  SMILES strings, PubChem compound IDs, accurate
                  reference DOIs, and others. One version of the
                  database is provided in the Supporting Information
                  of this article, but as ongoing updates are
                  envisioned, the database is now versioned and hosted
                  online. In addition to providing the database, this
                  work describes its construction process. The

                  free energies of 52 small drug-like molecules using

                  differs from previous studies in that (1) this was a

                  the past in typical solvation tests of all-atom
                  models. Overall, we found good correlations with
                  experimental values which were subsequently made
                  available, but the variances are large compared to
                  those in previous tests. We tested several different
                  charge models and found that several standard charge

                  and a system of switching functions is employed that
                  leads to a barrier in the lambda free energy profile
                  between the relevant thermodynamic end points. The
                  presence of such a barrier, therefore, enhances
                  sampling in the end point (lambda = 0 and lambda =
                  1) regions which are most important for computing
                  relevant free energy differences. In order to ensure
                  efficient barrier crossing, a high temperature
                  T(lambda) is assigned to lambda and a fictitious
                  mass m(lambda) is introduced as a means of creating
                  an adiabatic separation between lambda and the rest
                  of the system. Under these conditions, it is shown
                  that the lambda free energy profile can be directly
                  computed from the adiabatic probability distribution
                  function of lambda without any postprocessing or
                  unbiasing of the output data. The new method is
                  illustrated on two model problems and in the
                  calculation of the solvation free energy of amino
                  acid side-chain analogs in TIP3P water. Comparisons
                  to previous work using thermodynamic integration and
                  free energy perturbation show that the new lambda
                  adiabatic free energy dynamics method results in
                  very precise free energy calculations using
                  significantly shorter trajectories.",

                  the free energy perturbation formalism to show that

                  changes (CCs) of the entire system comprising the
                  solute and by the already known solvent
                  reorganization. The internal changes of enthalpy and
                  the entropy due to CCs upon modifying the
                  interactions (perturbation) cancel each other
                  exactly. The CCs influence the dissipation of the
                  modified interactions and their contributions to the
                  free energy. Using molecular simulations, we show
                  that, for solvation of six different HIV-1 protease
                  inhibitors, CCs in the solute cause EEC as large as

                  HIV-1 protease is shown to vary significantly upon

                  evaluated by using computer simulations for three
                  different force fields. The condition of chemical
                  equilibrium (i.e., equal chemical potential of the
                  salt in the solid and in the solution) is obtained
                  at room temperature and pressure to determine the
                  solubility of the salt. We used the same methodology
                  that was described in our previous work [E. Sanz and
                  C. Vega, J. Chem. Phys.126, 014507
                  (2007)]10.1063/1.2397683 although several
                  modifications were introduced to improve the
                  accuracy of the calculations. It is found that the
                  predictions of the solubility are quite sensitive to
                  the details of the force field used. Certain force
                  fields underestimate the experimental solubility of
                  NaCl in water by a factor of four, whereas the
                  predictions of other force fields are within 20\% of
                  the experimental value. Direct coexistence molecular
                  dynamic simulations were also performed to determine
                  the solubility of the salt. Reasonable agreement was
                  found between the solubility obtained from free
                  energy calculations and that obtained from direct
                  coexistence simulations. This work shows that the
                  evaluation of the solubility of salts in water can
                  now be performed in computer simulations. The
                  solubility depends on the ion-ion, ion-water, and
                  water-water interactions. For this reason, the
                  prediction of the solubility can be quite useful in
                  future work to develop force fields for ions in
                  water.",

                  (density and orientational distributions) are
                  presented. Both the Henry's law constants and the
                  separation factors depend exponentially on the
                  number of carbon atoms for the linear alkanes,
                  whereas chain branching and higher pressure lead to
                  a reduction of these properties. The solute density
                  profiles show oscillatory behavior along the surface
                  normal, and peaks in the number density are
                  correlated with a preference for parallel
                  orientations. The CBMC-GE approach allows for the
                  efficient calculation of these selective adsorption
                  phenomena, and data for multiple solutes (in the
                  dilute regime) can be extracted from a single

                  submitted predictions for cyclohexane/water
                  distribution coefficients for a set of 53 small
                  molecules. Distribution coefficients (log D) replace
                  the hydration free energies that were a central part
                  of the past five SAMPL challenges. A wide variety of
                  computational methods were represented by the 76
                  submissions from 18 participating groups. Here, we
                  analyze submissions by a variety of error metrics
                  and provide details for a number of reference
                  calculations we performed. As in the SAMPL4
                  challenge, we assessed the ability of participants
                  to evaluate not just their statistical uncertainty,
                  but their model uncertainty-how well they can
                  predict the magnitude of their model or force field
                  error for specific predictions. Unfortunately, this
                  remains an area where prediction and analysis need
                  improvement. In SAMPL4 the top performing
                  submissions achieved a root-mean-squared error
                  (RMSE) around 1.5 kcal/mol. If we anticipate
                  accuracy in log D predictions to be similar to the
                  hydration free energy predictions in SAMPL4, the
                  expected error here would be around 1.54 log
                  units. Only a few submissions had an RMSE below 2.5
                  log units in their predicted log D values. However,
                  distribution coefficients introduced complexities
                  not present in past SAMPL challenges, including
                  tautomer enumeration, that are likely to be
                  important in predicting biomolecular properties of
                  interest to drug discovery, therefore some decrease
                  in accuracy would be expected. Overall, the SAMPL5
                  distribution coefficient challenge provided great
                  insight into the importance of modeling a variety of
                  physical effects. We believe these types of
                  measurements will be a promising source of data for
                  future blind challenges, especially in view of the
                  relatively straightforward nature of the experiments
                  and the level of insight provided.",

                  on the base of ``autotroph'' concept of the origin
                  of life is presented in the paper. According to this
                  concept the origin of life took place in three
                  stages. The first stage was developed inside the
                  global geochemical cycle in which the turnover of
                  different chemical transformations was implemented
                  by solar radiation and/or heat energy of bowels of
                  the Earth. At the second stage, after the
                  autocatalytic systems have emerged these systems
                  evolved as a result of ``natural selection'' by
                  autocatalysis parameters up to emergence of special
                  inheritance systems that drastically improved the
                  autocatalysis parameters. The best in terms of
                  autocatalysis parameters were the autocatalysis
                  systems based on phase-separated particles where
                  complex structures can form not only on the basis of
                  covalent interactions. Such autocatalysis systems
                  can emerge only in liquid in a certain range of
                  temperatures and pressures. At this stage the
                  geochemical cycle complicated involving new
                  substances. At the third stage the evolution
                  involved improvement of inheritance systems
                  resulting in formation of the modern type of genetic
                  apparatus. This concept formed the basis to consider
                  approaches to experimental modeling of major aspects
                  of the origin of life and to outlining some general
                  features of life that can extend the sensitive

                  are intimately linked to the unique properties of
                  water, relying on the versatility with which water
                  interacts with molecules of varying sizes and
                  polarities. These interactions determine everything
                  from the structure and activity of proteins and
                  living cells to the geological partitioning of
                  water, oil, and minerals in the Earth's crust. The
                  role of hydrophobic hydration in the formation of
                  biological membranes and in protein folding, as well
                  as the importance of electrostatic interactions in
                  the hydration of polar and ionic species, are all
                  well known. However, the underlying molecular
                  mechanisms of hydration are often not as well
                  understood. This Account summarizes and extends
                  emerging understandings of these mechanisms to
                  reveal a newly unified view of hydration and explain
                  previously mystifying observations. For example,
                  rare gas atoms (e.g., Ar) and alkali-halide ions
                  (e.g., K+ and Cl-) have nearly identical
                  experimental hydration entropies, despite the
                  significant charge-induced reorganization of water
                  molecules. Here, we explain how such previously
                  mysterious observations may be understood as arising
                  from Gibbs inequalities, which impose rigorous
                  energetic upper and lower bounds on both hydration
                  free energies and entropies. These fundamental Gibbs
                  bounds depend only on the average interaction energy
                  of a solute with water, thus providing a deep link
                  between solute-water interaction energies and
                  entropies. One of the surprising consequences of the
                  emerging picture is the understanding that the
                  hydration of an ion produces two large but nearly
                  perfectly cancelling, entropic contributions: a
                  negative ion-water interaction entropy and a
                  positive water reorganization entropy. Recent work
                  has also clarified the relationship between the
                  strong cohesive energy of water and the free energy
                  required to form an empty hole (cavity) in
                  water. Here, we explain how linear response theory
                  (whose roots may also be traced to Gibbs
                  inequalities) can provide remarkably accurate
                  descriptions of the process of filling aqueous
                  cavities with nonpolar, polar, or charged
                  molecules. The hydration of nonpolar molecules is
                  well-described by first-order perturbation theory,
                  which implies that turning on solute-water van der
                  Waals interactions does not induce a significant
                  change in water structure. The larger changes in
                  water structure that are induced by polar and ionic
                  solutes are well-described by second-order
                  perturbation theory, which is equivalent to linear
                  response theory. Comparisons of the free energies of
                  nonpolar and polar or ionic solutes may be used to
                  experimentally determine electrostatic contributions
                  to water reorganization energies and entropies. The
                  success of this approach implies that water's
                  ability to respond to solutes of various polarities
                  is far from saturated, as illustrated by simulations
                  of acetonitrile (CH 3CN) in water, which reveal that
                  even such a strongly dipolar solute only produces
                  subtle changes in the structure of water.",

  abstract =	 "In a recent article (Bieler et al., J. Chem. Theory
                  Comput. 2014, 10, 3006), we introduced a combination
                  of λ-dynamics and local-elevation umbrella-sampling
                  termed λ-LEUS to calculate free-energy changes
                  associated with alchemical processes using molecular
                  dynamics simulations. This method was suggested to
                  be more efficient than thermodynamic integration
                  (TI), because the dynamical variation of the
                  alchemical variable λ opens up pathways to
                  circumvent barriers in the orthogonal space (defined
                  by the N -- 1 degrees of freedom that are not
                  subjected to the sampling enhancement), a feature
                  λ-LEUS shares with Hamiltonian replica-exchange (HR)
                  approaches. However, the mutation considered,
                  hydroquinone to benzene in water, was no real
                  challenge in terms of orthogonal-space properties,
                  which were restricted to solvent-relaxation
                  processes. In the present article, we revisit the
                  comparison between TI and λ-LEUS considering
                  non-trivial mutations of the central residue X of a
                  KXK tripeptide in water (with X = G, E, K, S, F, or
                  Y). Side-chain interactions that may include salt
                  bridges, hydrogen bonds or steric clashes lead to
                  slow relaxation in the orthogonal space, mainly in
                  the two-dimensional subspace spanned by the central
                  φ and ψ dihedral angles of the peptide. The
                  efficiency enhancement afforded by λ-LEUS is
                  confirmed in this more complex test system and can
                  be attributed explicitly to the improved sampling of
                  the orthogonal space. The sensitivity of the results
                  to the nontrivial choices of a mass parameter and of
                  a thermostat coupling time for the alchemical
                  variable is also investigated, resulting in
                  recommended ranges of 50 to 100 u nm2 and 0.2 to 0.5

                  predictions, which are confirmed

                  methods for calculating ligand binding free energies
                  that are all based on force fields and
                  conformational sampling. Many of these studies of
                  protein--ligand binding in the mid-1980s showed a
                  remarkable agreement between theory and experiment,
                  which led to an explosion of activity in the field
                  of free energy calculations. More recent
                  investigations, however, have demonstrated that
                  significantly longer simulations than those used in
                  the original reports are often required obtaining
                  reliable results in protein--ligand binding
                  studies. The increasing number of applications of
                  free energy calculations also showed that the use of
                  these methods was not as straightforward as
                  expected; therefore, much effort was spent on
                  improving the methodology. The free energy
                  perturbation (FEP)/thermodynamic integration (TI)
                  type of method has not really fulfilled its promise
                  of being able to open a major new avenue to
                  structure-based drug design due to slow convergence
                  and sampling difficulties. In particular, in this
                  type of extrapolation process in which one may want
                  to look at 20 or so new ligands, arriving at the
                  correct end-points by long perturbation paths
                  sometimes seems hopeless. It appears that a better
                  solution to this problem can often be provided by
                  automated docking of individual compounds, at least
                  when they differ significantly from each other, and
                  then to try to evaluate the binding energetic by a
                  method that does not require the unphysical
                  transformations involved in FEP/TI and related
                  methods. The docking problem resembles the
                  protein-folding one in many respects, and the only
                  way to attack difficult cases seems to be by
                  extensive conformational searching in combination
                  with more reliable scoring methods.",

                  beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD), relative to alpha- and

                  the perspective of water organization and internal
                  motion of the macrocyclic rings. Whether modulation
                  in the hydration patterns and in the rigidity of the
                  molecular scaffold can be reconciled with the
                  hydration free energy of beta-CD to rationalize its
                  notorious low solubility remains open to further
                  investigation. In this contribution,
                  multi-nanosecond molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
                  have been carried out to investigate the hydration
                  process of alpha-, beta- and gamma-CD. The
                  distribution of water molecules involved in this
                  process and the linearity of intramolecular hydrogen
                  bonds have been analyzed. The results reported here
                  demonstrate that the anomalous solubility for
                  beta-CD can be essentially rationalized by its
                  greater rigidity conferred by the participating
                  intramolecular hydrogen bonds and the higher density
                  of water molecules of lesser mobility. The hydration
                  free energy of alpha-, beta- and gamma-CD was
                  computed using the free energy perturbation
                  method. This quantity is shown to increase with the
                  number of glucose units, thereby suggesting that the
                  anomalous solubility of beta-CD cannot be explained

  abstract =	 "Recent calorimetric studies of interactions between
                  small molecules and biomolecular targets have
                  generated renewed interest in the phenomenon of
                  entropy-enthalpy compensation. In these studies,
                  entropic and enthalpic contributions to binding are
                  observed to vary substantially and in an opposing
                  manner as the ligand or protein is modified, whereas
                  the binding free energy varies little. In severe
                  examples, engineered enthalpic gains can lead to
                  completely compensating entropic penalties,
                  frustrating ligand design. Here, we examine the
                  evidence for compensation, as well as its potential
                  origins, prevalence, severity, and ramifications for
                  ligand engineering. We find the evidence for severe
                  compensation to be weak in light of the large
                  magnitude of and correlation between errors in
                  experimental measurements of entropic and enthalpic
                  contributions to binding, though a limited form of
                  compensation may be common. Given the difficulty of
                  predicting or measuring entropic and enthalpic
                  changes to useful precision, or using this
                  information in design, we recommend ligand
                  engineering efforts instead focus on computational
                  and experimental methodologies to directly assess
                  changes in binding free energy.",

                  attraction can be modulated if a hydrophobic surface
                  is present near the two ions in water. Using
                  computer simulations with explicit and implicit
                  water, we study how an ion embedded on a hydrophobic
                  surface interacts with another nearby ion in
                  water. Using hydrophobic surfaces with different
                  curvatures, we find that the contact interaction
                  between a positive and negative ion is strongly
                  affected by the curvature of an adjacent surface,
                  either stabilizing or destabilizing the ion pair. We
                  also find that the solvent-separated ion pair (SSIP)
                  can be made more stable than the contacting ion pair
                  by the presence of a surface. This may account for
                  why bridging waters are often found in protein
                  crystal structures. We also note that implicit
                  solvent models do not account for SSIPs. Finally, we
                  find that there are charge asymmetries: an embedded
                  positive charge attracting a negative ion is
                  different than an embedded negative charge
                  attracting a positive ion. Such asymmetries are also
                  not predicted by implicit solvent models. These

                  prediction challenge for distribution coefficient
                  (LogD) of drug-like molecules with respect to the
                  cyclohexane/water partitioning system. All the
                  atomic parameters defined for 41 atom types in the

                  operating a standard genetic algorithm with respect
                  to water and cyclohexane solvents. In the
                  parameterizations for cyclohexane, the experimental
                  solvation free energy (ΔG sol ) data of 15 molecules
                  for 1-octanol were combined with those of 77
                  molecules for cyclohexane to construct a training
                  set because ΔG sol values of the former were
                  unavailable for cyclohexane in publicly accessible
                  databases. Using this hybrid training set, we
                  established the LogD prediction model with the
                  correlation coefficient (R), average error (AE), and
                  root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.55, 1.53, and
                  3.03, respectively, for the comparison of
                  experimental and computational results for 53 SAMPL5
                  molecules. The modest accuracy in LogD prediction
                  could be attributed to the incomplete optimization
                  of atomic solvation parameters for cyclohexane. With
                  respect to 31 SAMPL5 molecules containing the atom
                  types for which experimental reference data for ΔG
                  sol were available for both water and cyclohexane,
                  the accuracy in LogD prediction increased remarkably
                  with the R, AE, and RMSE values of 0.82, 0.89, and
                  1.60, respectively. This significant enhancement in
                  performance stemmed from the better optimization of
                  atomic solvation parameters by limiting the element
                  of training set to the molecules with experimental
                  ΔG sol data for cyclohexane. Due to the simplicity
                  in model building and to low computational cost for
                  parameterizations, the extended solvent-contact
                  model is anticipated to serve as a valuable
                  computational tool for LogD prediction upon the

                  designed to address the various electrostatic and
                  nonelectrostatic interactions that develop between a
                  molecule and a surrounding medium are particularly
                  efficient tools for studying the effects of
                  condensed phases on molecular structure, energetics,
                  properties, spectra, interaction potentials, and
                  dynamics. The SM8 model may be combined with density
                  functional theory or Hartree--Fock theory to
                  describe a solute's electronic structure and its
                  self-consistent-field polarization by a solvent. A
                  key feature is the use of class IV charge models to
                  obtain accurate charge distributions (either in the
                  vapor phase or in solution), even when using small
                  basis sets that are affordable for large systems. A
                  second key feature is that nonelectrostatic effects
                  due to cavity formation, dispersion interactions,
                  and changes in solvent structure are included in
                  terms of empirical atomic surface tensions that
                  depend on geometry but do not require atom-type
                  assignments by the user. Use of an analytic surface
                  area algorithm provides very stable energy gradients
                  that allow geometry optimization in solution. The
                  SM8 continuum model, the culmination of a series of
                  SMx models (x = 1--8), permits the modeling of such
                  diverse media as aqueous and organic solvents,
                  soils, lipid bilayers, and air--water interfaces. In
                  addition to predicting accurate transfer free
                  energies between gaseous and condensed phases or
                  between two different condensed phases, SMx models
                  have been useful for predicting the significant
                  influence of condensed phases on processes
                  associated with a change in molecular charge,
                  including acid/base equilibria and

                  with the computation of free energies of solvation
                  in the SM8 model. We also compare the accuracies of
                  the SM8 model with those of other continuum
                  solvation models. Finally, we highlight applications
                  of the SM8 models to compute ionic solvation free

                  (MD) simulations with results that are in good

                  near future. Two types of approaches are principally
                  used to compute binding free energies with MD
                  simulations. The most widely known are based on
                  alchemical free energy methods, in which the
                  interaction of the ligand with its surrounding are
                  progressively switched off. An alternative method is
                  to use a potential of mean force (PMF), in which the
                  ligand is physically separated from the protein
                  receptor. For both of these computational
                  approaches, restraining potentials affecting the
                  translational, rotational and conformational freedom
                  of the ligand and protein may be activated and
                  released during the simulations to aid convergence
                  and improve the sampling. Such restraining
                  potentials add bias to the simulations, but their
                  effects can be rigorously removed to yield a binding
                  free energy that is properly unbiased with respect
                  to the standard state. A review of recent results is
                  presented. Examples of computations with T4-lysozyme

                  aqueous solvation free energies (hydration free
                  energies). These approaches use a nonphysical
                  pathway to compute free energy differences from a

                  gained significant importance due to its
                  considerable potential in drug discovery. The
                  massive increase of computational power in recent
                  years substantiates the application of more accurate
                  theoretical methods for the calculation of binding
                  free energies. The impact of such advances is the
                  application of parent approaches, like computational
                  alanine scanning, to investigate in silico the
                  effect of amino-acid replacement in protein–ligand
                  and protein–protein complexes, or probe the
                  thermostability of individual proteins. Because
                  human effort represents a significant cost that
                  precludes the routine use of this form of

                  referred to as AlaScan, developed within the popular

                  free-energy perturbation as implemented in the

                  by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules
                  is one of the most important processes in adaptive
                  immune defense. Prediction of peptide–MHC (pMHC)
                  binding affinities is therefore a principal
                  objective of theoretical immunology. Machine
                  learning techniques achieve good results if
                  substantial experimental training data are
                  available. Approaches based on structural
                  information become necessary if sufficiently similar
                  training data are unavailable for a specific MHC
                  allele, although they have often been deemed to lack
                  accuracy. In this study, we use a free energy method
                  to rank the binding affinities of 12 diverse
                  peptides bound by a class I MHC molecule
                  HLA-A*02:01. The method is based on enhanced
                  sampling of molecular dynamics calculations in
                  combination with a continuum solvent approximation
                  and includes estimates of the configurational
                  entropy based on either a one or a three trajectory
                  protocol. It produces precise and reproducible free
                  energy estimates which correlate well with
                  experimental measurements. If the results are
                  combined with an amino acid hydrophobicity scale,
                  then an extremely good ranking of peptide binding
                  affinities emerges. Our approach is rapid, robust,
                  and applicable to a wide range of ligand–receptor
                  interactions without further adjustment. ",

                  to make such predictions is of similar importance to
                  their accuracy, precision, and reliability. In the
                  past few years, an ensemble based molecular dynamics
                  approach has been proposed that provides a route to

                  results are in very good agreement with experimental
                  data (90\% of calculations agree to within 1
                  kcal/mol), while the method is reproducible by
                  construction. Statistical uncertainties of the order
                  of 0.5 kcal/mol or less are achieved. We present a

                  central importance in computational biophysics and
                  structure-based drug design. Multiple recent
                  advances including the development of greatly
                  improved protein and ligand molecular mechanics
                  force fields, more efficient enhanced sampling

                  predictions of relative protein–ligand binding free
                  energies through the free energy perturbation (FEP)
                  methods. However, the existing FEP methods can only
                  be used to calculate the relative binding free
                  energies for R-group modifications or single-atom
                  modifications and cannot be used to efficiently
                  evaluate scaffold hopping modifications to a lead
                  molecule. Scaffold hopping or core hopping, a very
                  common design strategy in drug discovery projects,
                  is critical not only in the early stages of a
                  discovery campaign where novel active matter must be
                  identified but also in lead optimization where the
                  resolution of a variety of ADME/Tox problems may
                  require identification of a novel core structure. In
                  this paper, we introduce a method that enables
                  theoretically rigorous, yet computationally
                  tractable, relative protein–ligand binding free
                  energy calculations to be pursued for scaffold
                  hopping modifications. We apply the method to six
                  pharmaceutically interesting cases where diverse
                  types of scaffold hopping modifications were
                  required to identify the drug molecules ultimately
                  sent into the clinic. For these six diverse cases,
                  the predicted binding affinities were in close

  abstract =	 " Thermodynamic properties are often modeled by
                  classical force fields which describe the
                  interactions on the atomistic scale. Molecular
                  simulations are used for retrieving thermodynamic
                  data from such models, and many simulation
                  techniques and computer codes are available for that
                  purpose. In the present round robin study, the
                  following fundamental question is addressed: Will
                  different user groups working with different
                  simulation codes obtain coinciding results within
                  the statistical uncertainty of their data? A set of
                  24 simple simulation tasks is defined and solved by
                  five user groups working with eight molecular
                  simulation codes: DL\_POLY, GROMACS, IMC, LAMMPS,
                  ms2, NAMD, Tinker, and TOWHEE. Each task consists of
                  the definition of (1) a pure fluid that is described
                  by a force field and (2) the conditions under which
                  that property is to be determined. The fluids are
                  four simple alkanes: ethane, propane, n-butane, and
                  iso-butane. All force fields consider internal
                  degrees of freedom: OPLS, TraPPE, and a modified
                  OPLS version with bond stretching
                  vibrations. Density and potential energy are
                  determined as a function of temperature and pressure
                  on a grid which is specified such that all states
                  are liquid. The user groups worked independently and
                  reported their results to a central instance. The
                  full set of results was disclosed to all user groups
                  only at the end of the study. During the study, the
                  central instance gave only qualitative feedback. The
                  results reveal the challenges of carrying out
                  molecular simulations. Several iterations were
                  needed to eliminate gross errors. For most
                  simulation tasks, the remaining deviations between
                  the results of the different groups are acceptable
                  from a practical standpoint, but they are often
                  outside of the statistical errors of the individual
                  simulation data. However, there are also cases where
                  the deviations are unacceptable. This study
                  highlights similarities between computer experiments
                  and laboratory experiments, which are both subject
                  not only to statistical error but also to systematic
                  error. "

                  affinities for the binding of 107 ligands to 10
                  different proteins. Employing 20-Å truncated
                  spherical systems and only one intermediate state in

                  kJ/mol for 54\% of the studied relative affinities
                  and a precision of 0.5 kJ/mol on average. However,
                  only four of the proteins gave acceptable errors,
                  correlations, and rankings. The results could be
                  improved by using nine intermediate states in the

                  conditions. However, 27 of the calculated affinities
                  still gave errors of more than 4 kJ/mol, and for
                  three of the proteins the results were not
                  satisfactory. This shows that the performance of BAR
                  calculations depends on the target protein and that
                  several transformations gave poor results owing to
                  limitations in the molecular-mechanics force field
                  or the restricted sampling possible within a
                  reasonable simulation time. Still, the BAR results
                  are better than docking calculations for most of the

                  affinities. The tool employs fully atomistic

                  protease and seven of the natural substrates cleaved
                  by the protease. This enables the efficacy of these
                  inhibitors to be ranked across several mutant
                  strains of the protease relative to the
                  wildtype. BAC is a tool that utilizes the power

                  the stages required to compute free energies of
                  binding: model preparation, equilibration,
                  simulation, postprocessing, and data-marshaling
                  around the generally widely distributed compute
                  resources utilized. Such automation enables the

                  throughput manner not achievable by manual
                  methods. This paper describes the architecture and
                  workflow management of BAC and the function of each
                  of its components. Given adequate compute resources,
                  BAC can yield quantitative information regarding
                  drug resistance at the molecular level within 96
                  h. Such a timescale is of direct clinical relevance
                  and can assist in decision support for the
                  assessment of patient-specific optimal drug
                  treatment and the subsequent response to therapy for

  abstract =	 { The growing adoption of generalized-ensemble
                  algorithms for biomolecular simulation has resulted
                  in a resurgence in the use of the weighted histogram
                  analysis method (WHAM) to make use of all data
                  generated by these simulations. Unfortunately, the
                  original presentation of WHAM by Kumar et al. is not
                  directly applicable to data generated by these
                  methods. WHAM was originally formulated to combine
                  data from independent samplings of the canonical
                  ensemble, whereas many generalized-ensemble
                  algorithms sample from mixtures of canonical
                  ensembles at different temperatures. Sorting
                  configurations generated from a parallel tempering
                  simulation by temperature obscures the temporal
                  correlation in the data and results in an improper
                  treatment of the statistical uncertainties used in
                  constructing the estimate of the density of
                  states. Here we present variants of WHAM, STWHAM and
                  PTWHAM, derived with the same set of assumptions,
                  that can be directly applied to several generalized
                  ensemble algorithms, including simulated tempering,
                  parallel tempering (better known as replica-exchange
                  among temperatures), and replica-exchange simulated
                  tempering. We present methods that explicitly
                  capture the considerable temporal correlation in
                  sequentially generated configurations using
                  autocorrelation analysis. This allows estimation of
                  the statistical uncertainty in WHAM estimates of
                  expectations for the canonical ensemble. We test the
                  method with a one-dimensional model system and then
                  apply it to the estimation of potentials of mean
                  force from parallel tempering simulations of the
                  alanine dipeptide in both implicit and explicit
                  solvent. }

                  to calculate free energies. Amber has traditionally
                  included support for alchemical transformations as
                  part of the sander molecular dynamics (MD)
                  engine. Here, we describe the implementation of a
                  more efficient approach to alchemical
                  transformations in the Amber MD
                  package. Specifically, we have implemented this new
                  approach within the more computationally efficient
                  and scalable pmemd MD engine that is included with
                  the Amber MD package. The majority of the gain in
                  efficiency comes from the improved design of the
                  calculation, which includes better parallel scaling
                  and reduction in the calculation of redundant
                  terms. This new implementation is able to reproduce
                  results from equivalent simulations run with the

                  objective of small-molecule drug discovery. Over the
                  past few decades, free-energy calculations have
                  benefited from improved force fields and sampling
                  algorithms, as well as the advent of low-cost
                  parallel computing. However, it has proven to be
                  challenging to reliably achieve the level of
                  accuracy that would be needed to guide lead
                  optimization (∼5× in binding affinity) for a wide
                  range of ligands and protein targets. Not
                  surprisingly, widespread commercial application of
                  free-energy simulations has been limited due to the
                  lack of large-scale validation coupled with the
                  technical challenges traditionally associated with
                  running these types of calculations. Here, we report
                  an approach that achieves an unprecedented level of
                  accuracy across a broad range of target classes and
                  ligands, with retrospective results encompassing 200

                  synthesized that have been predicted to be

                  basis of other computational or medicinal chemistry
                  approaches. Furthermore, the results are consistent

                  simulations is analyzed, and an exact method to
                  carry out such a computation is presented. The key
                  to obtaining converged results is the introduction
                  of suitable, auxiliary restraints to prevent the
                  ligand from leaving the binding site when the native
                  ligand−receptor interactions are turned off
                  alchemically. We describe a versatile set of
                  restraints that (i) can be used in MD simulations,
                  that (ii) restricts both the position and the
                  orientation of the ligand, and that (iii) is defined
                  relative to the receptor rather than relative to a
                  fixed point in space. The free energy cost, ΔAr, for
                  this set of restraints can be evaluated
                  analytically. Although the techniques were
                  originally developed for the gas phase, the
                  resulting expression is exact, since all
                  contributions from solute−solvent interactions
                  cancel from the final result. The value of ΔAr
                  depends only on the equilibrium values and force
                  constants of the chosen harmonic restraint terms
                  and, therefore, can be easily calculated. The
                  standard state dependence of binding free energies
                  is also investigated, and it is shown that the
                  present approach takes this into account
                  correctly. The analytical expression for ΔAr is
                  verified numerically by calculations on the complex
                  formed by benzene with the L99A mutant of T4
                  lysozyme. The overall approach is illustrated by a

                  complex based on a simplified model for tyrosine

                  powerful tool that can play a predictive role in a
                  wide range of research areas. Yet, the reliability
                  of these calculations can often be improved
                  significantly if a number of precepts, or good
                  practices, are followed. Although the theory upon
                  which these good practices rely has largely been
                  known for many years, it is often overlooked or
                  simply ignored. In other cases, the theoretical
                  developments are too recent for their potential to
                  be fully grasped and merged into popular platforms
                  for the computation of free-energy differences. In
                  this contribution, the current best practices for

                  challenged by limited performance, accuracy, and
                  creation of topologies for arbitrary small
                  molecules. This has made it difficult to
                  systematically compare different sets of parameters
                  to improve existing force fields, but in the past
                  few years several authors have developed
                  increasingly automated procedures to generate
                  parameters for force fields such as Amber, CHARMM,

                  small molecules using the GAFF, OPLS-AA, and CGenFF
                  force fields and four different water models, and by
                  including the often neglected polarization costs, we

  abstract =	 " The role of the bonded (bond stretching and bond
                  angle) force-field terms in free energy simulations
                  is examined. It is shown that the proper treatment
                  of such terms depends on the choice of the free
                  energy methodology (single or dual
                  topology). Furthermore, while there are no problems
                  in describing changes in bonded terms, care has to
                  be used in creating or destroying them in a
                  molecular dynamics simulation. An approach that
                  avoids the singularity caused by a bond with a zero
                  force constant is outlined. Changes in bond
                  stretching or bond angle terms are shown to give
                  rise to vibrational, Jacobian factor, and
                  potential-of-mean-force-type (pmf)
                  contributions. The meaning of bond stretching and
                  bond angle bending free energy components obtained
                  in single and dual topology simulations and their
                  connection to these three contributions is
                  investigated. Due to the different end states used
                  in single and dual topology simulations, the pmf
                  contribution is projected on different free energy
                  components. In certain dual topology methods,
                  vibrational and Jacobian factor contributions are
                  not included in the free energy
                  difference. Therefore, single free energy
                  differences (e.g., the free energy difference
                  between two molecules in the gas phase and in
                  solution) often cannot be compared directly between
                  single and dual topology methods. However, identical
                  double free energy differences (e.g., free energy
                  differences of solvation) are obtained in all
                  cases. The present analysis emphasizes the
                  importance of the details of the simulation
                  methodology in interpreting the results for bonded
                  terms and reconciles apparently contradictory

                  model systems are investigated:  (a) two
                  one-dimensional harmonic oscillators interacting
                  with a third particle that represents the solvent,

                  of the single and double free energy differences

                  vibrational, pmf-type, and Jacobian factor terms.The

                  illustrative examples provides the basis for
                  addressing the question of whether the so-called
                  self-terms can make significant contributions to
                  double free energy differences. This is accomplished
                  by identifying the effect of coupling of the three
                  contributions from bonded energy terms on a double
                  free energy difference. For the model systems
                  studied, coupling and, hence, self-terms are found
                  to be of little importance. The analysis resolves

                  substitutions were investigated using molecular
                  dynamics free energy simulations (MD/FES). A focus
                  of the present study is how one can treat some of
                  the intrinsic problems associated with the use of
                  dummy atoms, which are introduced in standard MD/FES
                  procedures working with a constant number of
                  particles. Specifically, we show how one can
                  introduce dummy atoms, which retain all the covalent
                  interactions, in a “hybrid residue”, in such a way
                  that the influence of the bonded interactions with
                  dummy atoms do not influence the final free energy
                  change. The simulations thus can be done using a
                  transformation protocol in which all covalent bond
                  contributions are maintained invariant throughout
                  the calculations; only the nonbonded interactions
                  are varied. That is, the number of atoms is
                  maintained constant by introducing dummy atoms,
                  which are covalently linked to the protein in
                  question, but which have no nonbonded interactions
                  at one or the other of the two end point reference
                  states. The potential energy function describing the
                  transformation was constructed such that all
                  internal energy terms are invariant with respect to
                  the thermodynamic coupling parameter λ (0 ≤ λ ≤
                  1). This simulation procedure therefore has
                  similarities with both the “single topology” and
                  “dual topology” methods, which have been used in
                  other investigations. This transformation and MD/FES
                  strategy was evaluated using three different
                  systems, in which an Ala is transformed into a Val
                  (the italicized residues were transformed):
                  formyl-Ala-ethanolamine;
                  formyl-(Ala)3-Ala-Ala-Ala-(Ala)3-ethanolamine (as an
                  α-helix); and
                  formyl-(Ala)3-Val-Ala-Val-(Ala)3-ethanolamine (as an
                  α-helix). The calculations examined how the free
                  energy difference associated with an Ala-to-Val
                  transformation depends on the choice of
                  transformation path, the equilibration time, and the
                  number windows used in the calculation. The results
                  show that MD/FES provides for stable energy
                  estimates for any intermediate state, as defined by
                  the coupling parameter λ, including the end point
                  reference states:  λ = 0 and λ = 1. With an
                  appropriate choice of sigmoid transformation path,
                  free energy changes with minimal variability and
                  good reversibility were obtained for all three
                  systems using MD/FES lasting longer than 2.4 ns. ",

                  pure molecular mechanical (MM) simulations, hybrid
                  quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) free
                  energy simulations particularly require a careful
                  consideration of balancing computational cost and
                  accuracy. Here, we review several recent

                  QM/MM simulations and discuss several topics
                  motivated by these developments using simple but
                  informative examples that involve processes in
                  water. For chemical reactions, we highlight the
                  value of invoking enhanced sampling technique
                  (e.g. replica-exchange) in umbrella sampling
                  calculations and the value of including collective
                  environmental variables (e.g. hydration level) in
                  metadynamics simulations; we also illustrate the
                  sensitivity of string calculations, especially free
                  energy along the path, to various parameters in the
                  computation. Alchemical free energy simulations with
                  a specific thermodynamic cycle are used to probe the
                  effect of including the first solvation shell into
                  the QM region when computing solvation free
                  energies. For cases where high-level QM/MM potential
                  functions are needed, we analyse two different
                  approaches: the QM/MM–MFEP method of Yang and
                  co-workers and perturbative correction to low-level
                  QM/MM free energy results. For the examples analysed
                  here, both approaches seem productive although care
                  needs to be exercised when analysing the
                  perturbative corrections. ",

                  systems are reviewed with particular emphasis on
                  applications relevant in materials science. First,
                  traditional methodologies based on harmonic
                  approximations and thermodynamic integration are
                  examined to highlight the workings of these very

                  specialized strategies are then discussed to provide
                  a snapshot of current practices. Our aim here is to
                  compare and contrast several related techniques and
                  to provide an assessment of their relative

                  with computational speeds approaching those of
                  implicit-solvent models. We use an explicit-water
                  model to precompute properties of water solvation
                  shells around simple spheres, then assemble a
                  solute's solvation shell by combining the shells of
                  these spheres. SEA improves upon implicit-solvent
                  models of solvation free energies by accounting for
                  local solute curvature, accounting for near-neighbor

                  one of the grand challenges in the field of
                  molecular simulation. Difficulties in the study of
                  such systems arise from the need (i) to accurately
                  model both strong, short-ranged interactions leading
                  to the formation of chemical bonds and weak
                  interactions arising from the environment, and (ii)
                  to sample the range of time scales involving
                  frequent molecular collisions, slow diffusion, and
                  infrequent reactive events. Here we present a novel
                  reactive first-principles Monte Carlo (RxFPMC)
                  approach that allows for investigation of reaction
                  equilibria without the need to prespecify a set of
                  chemical reactions and their ideal-gas equilibrium
                  constants. We apply RxFPMC to investigate a
                  nitrogen/oxygen mixture at T = 3000 K and p = 30
                  GPa, i.e., conditions that are present in
                  atmospheric lightning strikes and explosions. The
                  RxFPMC simulations show that the solvation
                  environment leads to a significantly enhanced NO
                  concentration that reaches a maximum when oxygen is
                  present in slight excess. In addition, the RxFPMC
                  simulations indicate the formation of NO2 and N2O in
                  mole fractions approaching 1\%, whereas N3 and O3
                  are not observed. The equilibrium distributions
                  obtained from the RxFPMC simulations agree well with

                  the Analytical Generalized Born plus Non-Polar
                  (AGBNP) model we have previously reported, is
                  presented with the aim of modeling hydration effects
                  beyond those described by conventional continuum
                  dielectric representations. A new empirical
                  hydration free energy component based on a procedure
                  to locate and score hydration sites on the solute
                  surface is introduced to model first solvation shell
                  effects, such as hydrogen bonding, which are poorly
                  described by continuum dielectric models. This new
                  component is added to the Generalized Born and
                  non-polar AGBNP terms. Also newly introduced is an
                  analytical Solvent Excluded Volume (SEV) model which
                  improves the solute volume description by reducing
                  the effect of spurious high-dielectric interstitial
                  spaces present in conventional van der Waals
                  representations. The AGBNP2 model is parametrized
                  and tested with respect to experimental hydration
                  free energies of small molecules and the results of
                  explicit solvent simulations. Modeling the
                  granularity of water is one of the main design
                  principles employed for the the first shell
                  solvation function and the SEV model, by requiring
                  that water locations have a minimum available volume
                  based on the size of a water molecule. It is shown
                  that the new volumetric model produces Born radii
                  and surface areas in good agreement with accurate
                  numerical evaluations of these quantities. The
                  results of molecular dynamics simulations of a
                  series of mini-proteins show that the new model
                  produces conformational ensembles in substantially
                  better agreement with reference explicit solvent

                  dynamics simulations and high-resolution
                  modeling. It is based on a novel implementation of
                  the pairwise descreening Generalized Born model for
                  the electrostatic component and a new nonpolar
                  hydration free energy estimator. The nonpolar term
                  consists of an estimator for the solute-solvent van
                  der Waals dispersion energy designed to mimic the
                  continuum solvent solute-solvent van der Waals
                  interaction energy, in addition to a surface area
                  term corresponding to the work of cavity
                  formation. AGBNP makes use of a new parameter-free
                  algorithm to calculate the scaling coefficients used
                  in the pairwise descreening scheme to take into
                  account atomic overlaps. The same algorithm is also
                  used to calculate atomic surface areas. We show that
                  excellent agreement is achieved for the GB
                  self-energies and surface areas in comparison to
                  accurate, but much more expensive, numerical
                  evaluations. The parameter-free approach used in
                  AGBNP and the sensitivity of the AGBNP model with
                  respect to large and small conformational changes
                  makes the model suitable for high-resolution
                  modeling of protein loops and receptor sites as well
                  as high-resolution prediction of the structure and
                  thermodynamics of protein-ligand complexes. We
                  present illustrative results for these kinds of
                  benchmarks. The model is fully analytical with first
                  derivatives and is computationally efficient. It has

                  calculations based on molecular dynamics
                  simulations. A thermodynamic integration scheme is
                  often used to calculate changes in the free energy
                  of a system by integrating the change of the
                  system's Hamiltonian with respect to a coupling

                  in nonequilibrium free energy calculations that
                  alleviates singularities, numerical instabilities,
                  and additional minima in the potential energy for
                  all combinations of nonbonded interactions at all
                  intermediate alchemical states. The method was
                  validated by application to (a) the free energy
                  calculations of a closed thermodynamic cycle, (b)
                  the mutation influence on protein thermostability,
                  (c) calculations of small ligand solvation free
                  energies, and (d) the estimation of binding free
                  energies of trypsin inhibitors. The results show
                  that the novel soft-core function provides a robust
                  and accurate general purpose solution to alchemical
                  free energy calculations.",

                  estimating the solvation free energies in water and
                  cyclohexane of the 53 compounds in the
                  challenge. These free energies were computed using
                  alchemical free energy simulations based on a hybrid
                  all-atom/coarse-grained model. The compounds were
                  treated with the general Amber force field, whereas
                  the solvent molecules were treated with the Elba
                  coarse-grained model. Considering the simplicity of
                  the solvent model and that we approximate the
                  distribution coefficient with the partition
                  coefficient of the neutral species, the predictions
                  are of good accuracy. The correlation coefficient, R
                  is 0.64, 82 \% of the predictions have the correct
                  sign and the mean absolute deviation is 1.8 log
                  units. This is on a par with or better than the
                  other simulation-based predictions in the
                  challenge. We present an analysis of the deviations
                  to experiments and compare the predictions to

                  constrains, to some extent at least, the stability
                  in many natural proteins. If, during protein
                  evolution, stability fluctuates within a
                  comparatively narrow range, then mutations are
                  expected to be fixed with frequencies that reflect
                  mutational effects on stability. Indeed, we recently
                  reported a robust correlation between the effect of
                  27 conservative mutations on the thermodynamic
                  stability (unfolding free energy) of Escherichia
                  coli thioredoxin and the frequencies of residues
                  occurrences in sequence alignments. We show here
                  that this correlation likely implies a lower limit
                  to thermodynamic stability of only a few kJ/mol
                  below the unfolding free energy of the wild-type
                  (WT) protein. We suggest, therefore, that the
                  correlation does not reflect natural selection of
                  thermodynamic stability by itself, but of some other
                  factor which is linked to thermodynamic stability
                  for the mutations under study. We propose that this
                  other factor is the kinetic stability of thioredoxin
                  in vivo, since( i) kinetic stability relates to
                  irreversible denaturation, (ii) the rate of
                  irreversible denaturation in a crowded cellular
                  environment (or in a harsh extracellular
                  environment) is probably determined by the rate of
                  unfolding, and (iii) the half-life for unfolding
                  changes in an exponential manner with activation
                  free energy and, consequently, comparatively small
                  free energy effects can have deleterious
                  consequences for kinetic stability. This proposal is
                  supported by the results of a kinetic study of the
                  WT form and the 27 single-mutant variants of E. coli
                  thioredoxin based on the global analyses of chevron
                  plots and equilibrium unfolding profiles determined
                  from double-jump unfolding assays. This kinetic
                  study suggests, furthermore, one of the factors that
                  may contribute to the high activation free energy
                  for unfolding in thioredoxin (required for kinetic
                  stability), namely the energetic optimization of
                  native-state residue environments in regions, which
                  become disrupted in the transition state for

                  required to evaluate its impact on atmospheric

                  with an update on the current state of knowledge on
                  the global SOA budget and is followed by an overview
                  of the atmospheric degradation mechanisms for SOA

                  following topical and emerging issues are
                  highlighted and discussed in detail: molecular
                  characterization of biogenic SOA constituents,
                  condensed phase reactions and oligomerization, the
                  interaction of atmospheric organic components with

                  interaction of atmospheric organic components with
                  water, thermodynamics and mixtures in atmospheric
                  models. Finally, the major challenges ahead in

                  to play a role in the radiation damage processes of
                  DNA. Our recent studies suggested that the excess
                  electron attachment to the nucleic acid bases can
                  stabilize some rare tautomers, i.e. imine-enamine
                  tautomers and other tautomers with a proton being
                  transferred from nitrogen sites to carbon sites
                  (with respect to the canonical tautomer). So far,
                  these new anionic tautomers have been characterized
                  by the gas-phase electronic structure calculations
                  and photoelectron spectroscopy experiments. In the
                  current contribution we explore the effect of water
                  solvation on the stability of the new anionic
                  tautomers of uracil. The accurate free energies of
                  solvation are calculated in a two step approach. The
                  major contribution was calculated using the
                  classical free-energy perturbation
                  adiabatic-charging approach, where it is assumed
                  that the solvated molecule has the charge
                  distribution given by the polarizable continuum
                  model. In the second step the free energy of
                  solvation is refined by taking into account the
                  real, average solvent charge distribution. This is
                  done using our accelerated QM/MM simulations, where
                  the QM energy of the solute is calculated in the
                  mean potential averaged over many MD steps. We found
                  that in water solution three of the recently
                  identified anionic tautomers are 6.5-3.6 kcal
                  mol(-1) more stable than the anion of the canonical
                  tautomer.",

                  free energy required to remove solvent from what
                  will become the molecular interior and the free
                  energy gained from dispersive interactions between
                  the solute and solvent. Traditionally, these free
                  energies have been assumed to be proportional to the
                  surface area of the molecule. However, we computed
                  these free energies for a series of alkanes and four
                  configurations of decaalanine and showed that
                  although these free energies were linear in the
                  surface area for each set of molecules, each atom's
                  contributions to these energies depended on
                  correlations with its surrounding atoms. The atomic
                  contributions to these energies were therefore not
                  additive. This finding suggests that most current
                  hydrophobic models are unsatisfactory., Inserting an
                  uncharged van der Waals (vdw) cavity into water
                  disrupts the distribution of water and creates
                  attractive dispersion interactions between the
                  solvent and solute. This free-energy change is the
                  hydrophobic solvation energy (ΔGvdw). Frequently, it
                  is assumed to be linear in the solvent-accessible
                  surface area, with a positive surface tension (γ)
                  that is independent of the properties of the
                  molecule. However, we found that γ for a set of
                  alkanes differed from that for four configurations
                  of decaalanine, and γ = −5 was negative for the
                  decaalanines. These findings conflict with the
                  notion that ΔGvdw favors smaller A. We broke ΔGvdw
                  into the free energy required to exclude water from
                  the vdw cavity (ΔGrep) and the free energy of
                  forming the attractive interactions between the
                  solute and solvent (ΔGatt) and found that γ
                  {\textless} 0 for the decaalanines because −γatt
                  {\textgreater} γrep and γatt {\textless}
                  0. Additionally, γatt and γrep for the alkanes
                  differed from those for the decaalanines, implying
                  that none of ΔGatt, ΔGrep, and ΔGvdw can be computed
                  with a constant surface tension. We also showed that
                  ΔGatt could not be computed from either the initial
                  or final water distributions, implying that this
                  quantity is more difficult to compute than is
                  sometimes assumed. Finally, we showed that each
                  atom's contribution to γrep depended on multibody
                  interactions with its surrounding atoms, implying
                  that these contributions are not additive. These
                  findings call into question some hydrophobic

                  central importance in population genetics, and so
                  far, they have formed the basis of most theoretical
                  and applied population genetic research. In the
                  present work, we explore the effect that the
                  ordering of natural selection and population
                  regulation in the life cycle has on the resulting
                  population dynamics under the Wright-Fisher model,
                  especially for the evolution of one- and two-locus
                  systems. With weak natural selection, the details of
                  how to order natural selection and population
                  regulation in the life cycle do not matter in the
                  Wright-Fisher model and its diffusion
                  approximation. By contrast, we show that when there
                  is strong natural selection and the population is in
                  linkage disequilibrium, there can be appreciable
                  differences in the resulting population dynamics
                  under the Wright-Fisher model, depending on whether
                  natural selection occurs before or after population
                  regulation in the life cycle. We argue that this
                  effect may be of significance in natural populations
                  subject to gene migration and local selection.",

                  Narten. The computed densities and potential
                  energies are in reasonable accord with experiment
                  except for the original BF model, which yields an
                  18\% overestimate of the density and poor structural
                  results. The TIPS2 and TIP4P potentials yield

                  may be due to the correction terms needed in

                  descriptions of liquid water and they should be
                  useful in simulations of aqueous solutions. The

                  simulations show considerable promise for
                  applications ranging from drug discovery to
                  prediction of physical properties and
                  structure-function studies. But these calculations
                  are still difficult and tedious to analyze, and best
                  practices for analysis are not well defined or
                  propagated. Essentially, each group analyzing these
                  calculations needs to decide how to conduct the
                  analysis and, usually, develop its own analysis
                  tools. Here, we review and recommend best practices
                  for analysis yielding reliable free energies from
                  molecular simulations. Additionally, we provide a
                  Python tool, alchemical-analysis.py , freely
                  available on GitHub as part of the pymbar package
                  (located at http://github.com/choderalab/pymbar ),
                  that implements the analysis practices reviewed here
                  for several reference simulation packages, which can
                  be adapted to handle data from other packages. Both
                  this review and the tool covers analysis of
                  alchemical calculations generally, including free
                  energy estimates via both thermodynamic integration
                  and free energy perturbation-based estimators. Our
                  Python tool also handles output from multiple types
                  of free energy calculations, including expanded
                  ensemble and Hamiltonian replica exchange, as well
                  as standard fixed ensemble calculations. We also
                  survey a range of statistical and graphical ways of
                  assessing the quality of the data and free energy
                  estimates, and provide prototypes of these in our
                  tool. We hope this tool and discussion will serve as
                  a foundation for more standardization of and

                  the insertion and deletion of charged particles in

                  path to introduce Coulombic interactions into
                  various molecules in solution and find that this
                  near optimal path is only marginally more efficient
                  than simple linear coupling of electrostatics in all
                  cases where a repulsive core is already present. We
                  also explore the order in which nonbonded forces are
                  coupled to the environment in alchemical
                  transformations. We test two sets of Lennard-Jones
                  basis functions, a Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA) and
                  a 12-6 decomposition of the repulsive and attractive
                  forces turned on in sequence along with changes in
                  charge, to determine a statistically optimized order
                  in which forces should be coupled. The WCA
                  decomposition has lower statistical uncertainty as
                  coupling the attractive r(-6) basis function
                  contributes non-negligible statistical error. In all
                  cases, the charge should be coupled only after the
                  repulsive core is fully coupled, and the WCA
                  attractive portion can be coupled at any stage
                  without significantly changing the efficiency. The
                  statistical uncertainty of two of the basis function
                  approaches with charged particles is nearly
                  identical to the soft core approach for decoupling
                  electrostatics, though the correlation times for
                  sampling are often longer for a soft core
                  electrostatics approach than the basis function
                  approach. The basis function approach for
                  introducing or removing molecules or functional
                  groups thus represents a useful alternative to the

                  energy based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
                  generally relies on a thermodynamic cycle in which
                  the ligand is alchemically inserted into the system,
                  both in the solvated protein and free in
                  solution. The corresponding ligand-insertion free
                  energies are typically calculated in nanoscale
                  computational boxes simulated under periodic
                  boundary conditions and considering electrostatic
                  interactions defined by a periodic lattice-sum. This
                  is distinct from the ideal bulk situation of a
                  system of macroscopic size simulated under
                  non-periodic boundary conditions with Coulombic
                  electrostatic interactions. This discrepancy results
                  in finite-size effects, which affect primarily the
                  charging component of the insertion free energy, are
                  dependent on the box size, and can be large when the
                  ligand bears a net charge, especially if the protein
                  is charged as well. This article investigates
                  finite-size effects on calculated charging free
                  energies using as a test case the binding of the
                  ligand 2-amino-5-methylthiazole (net charge +1 e) to
                  a mutant form of yeast cytochrome c peroxidase in
                  water. Considering different charge isoforms of the
                  protein (net charges -5, 0, +3, or +9 e), either in
                  the absence or the presence of neutralizing
                  counter-ions, and sizes of the cubic computational
                  box (edges ranging from 7.42 to 11.02 nm), the
                  potentially large magnitude of finite-size effects
                  on the raw charging free energies (up to 17.1 kJ
                  mol(-1)) is demonstrated. Two correction schemes are
                  then proposed to eliminate these effects, a
                  numerical and an analytical one. Both schemes are
                  based on a continuum-electrostatics analysis and
                  require performing Poisson-Boltzmann (PB)
                  calculations on the protein-ligand system. While the
                  numerical scheme requires PB calculations under both
                  non-periodic and periodic boundary conditions, the
                  latter at the box size considered in the MD
                  simulations, the analytical scheme only requires
                  three non-periodic PB calculations for a given
                  system, its dependence on the box size being
                  analytical. The latter scheme also provides insight
                  into the physical origin of the finite-size
                  effects. These two schemes also encompass a
                  correction for discrete solvent effects that
                  persists even in the limit of infinite box
                  sizes. Application of either scheme essentially
                  eliminates the size dependence of the corrected
                  charging free energies (maximal deviation of 1.5 kJ
                  mol(-1)). Because it is simple to apply, the
                  analytical correction scheme offers a general
                  solution to the problem of finite-size effects in
                  free-energy calculations involving charged solutes,
                  as encountered in calculations concerning, e.g.,

                  processes, such as ligand binding or transfer of a

                  are much more amenable to computational simulation

                  difference (DeltaF) methods. The analysis includes
                  both equilibrium and nonequilibrium approaches, and
                  distinguishes between unidirectional and
                  bidirectional methodologies. We are primarily
                  interested in comparing two recently proposed
                  approaches, adaptive integration, and
                  single-ensemble path sampling to more established
                  methodologies. As test cases, we study relative
                  solvation free energies of large changes to the size
                  or charge of a Lennard-Jones particle in explicit
                  water. The results show that, for the systems used
                  in this study, both adaptive integration and path
                  sampling offer unique advantages over the more
                  traditional approaches. Specifically, adaptive
                  integration is found to provide very precise
                  long-simulation DeltaF estimates as compared to
                  other methods used in this report, while also
                  offering rapid estimation of DeltaF. The results
                  demonstrate that the adaptive integration approach
                  is the best overall method for the systems studied
                  here. The single-ensemble path sampling approach is
                  found to be superior to ordinary Jarzynski averaging
                  for the unidirectional, ``fast-growth''
                  nonequilibrium case. Closer examination of the path
                  sampling approach on a two-dimensional system
                  suggests it may be the overall method of choice when
                  conformational sampling barriers are high. However,
                  it appears that the free energy landscapes for the
                  systems used in this study have rather modest
                  configurational sampling barriers.",

                  Jarzynski's equality is that DeltaF estimates

                  large, costly data sets. The purpose of the work
                  presented here is to determine the best estimate for
                  DeltaF given a (finite) set of work values
                  previously generated by simulation or

                  Jarzynski's equality, for modest sized data sets

                  from one of the new methods suggest that good
                  estimates of DeltaF can be obtained using 5-40-fold
                  less data than was previously possible. Extending
                  previous work, the new results exploit the
                  systematic behavior of bias due to finite sample
                  size. A key innovation is better use of the more

                  variable $\lambda$ was studied for the annihilation
                  and creation of neon in aqueous solution. The method
                  was further tested on the calculation of the free
                  energy of aqueous solvation of a small molecule,
                  ethanol. In contrast to linear scaling of the LJ
                  potential during TI, the calculated free energies
                  using the new separation--shifted scaling approach
                  are reasonably well converged after 200--500 ps of
                  simulation and show smaller hysteresis comparing
                  forward and reverse TI.",
