  Abstract                 = {A new molecular dynamics method for calculating free energies associated with transformations of the thermodynamic state or chemical composition of a system (also known as alchemical transformations) is presented. The new method extends the adiabatic dynamics approach recently introduced by Rosso et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 116, 4389 (2002)] and is based on the use of an additional degree of freedom, lambda, that is used as a switching parameter between the potential energy functions that characterize the two states. In the new method, the coupling parameter lambda is introduced as a fictitious dynamical variable in the Hamiltonian, and a system of switching functions is employed that leads to a barrier in the lambda free energy profile between the relevant thermodynamic end points. The presence of such a barrier, therefore, enhances sampling in the end point (lambda = 0 and lambda = 1) regions which are most important for computing relevant free energy differences. In order to ensure efficient barrier crossing, a high temperature T(lambda) is assigned to lambda and a fictitious mass m(lambda) is introduced as a means of creating an adiabatic separation between lambda and the rest of the system. Under these conditions, it is shown that the lambda free energy profile can be directly computed from the adiabatic probability distribution function of lambda without any postprocessing or unbiasing of the output data. The new method is illustrated on two model problems and in the calculation of the solvation free energy of amino acid side-chain analogs in TIP3P water. Comparisons to previous work using thermodynamic integration and free energy perturbation show that the new lambda adiabatic free energy dynamics method results in very precise free energy calculations using significantly shorter trajectories.},

  Abstract                 = {The change in free energy is the dominant factor in all chemical processes; it usually encompasses enthalpy− entropy compensation (EEC). Here, we use the free energy perturbation formalism to show that EEC is influenced by the molecular conformational changes (CCs) of the entire system comprising the solute and by the already known solvent reorganization. The internal changes of enthalpy and the entropy due to CCs upon modifying the interactions (perturbation) cancel each other exactly. The CCs influence the dissipation of the modified interactions and their contributions to the free energy. Using molecular simulations, we show that, for solvation of six different HIV-1 protease inhibitors, CCs in the solute cause EEC as large as 10−30 kcal/mol. Moreover, the EEC due to CCs in HIV-1 protease is shown to vary significantly upon modifying its bound ligand. These findings have important implications for understanding of EEC phenomena and for interpretation of thermodynamic measurements.},

  Abstract                 = {A general set of methods is presented for calculating chemical potentials in solid and liquid mixtures using ab initio techniques based on density functional theory (DFT). The methods are designed to give an ab initio approach to treating chemical equilibrium between coexisting solid and liquid solutions, and particularly the partitioning ratios of solutes between such solutions. For the liquid phase, the methods are based on the general technique of thermodynamic integration, applied to calculate the change of free energy associated with the continuous interconversion of solvent and solute atoms, the required thermal averages being computed by DFT molecular dynamics simulation. For the solid phase, free energies and hence chemical potentials are obtained using DFT calculation of vibrational frequencies of systems containing substitutional solute atoms, with anharmonic contributions calculated, where needed, by thermodynamic integration. The practical use of the methods is illustrated by applying them to study chemical equilibrium between the outer liquid and inner solid parts of the Earth's core, modeled as solutions of S, Si, and O in Fe. The calculations place strong constraints on the chemical composition of the core, and allow an estimate of the temperature at the inner-core/outer-core boundary.

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, the solubility of NaCl in water is evaluated by using computer simulations for three different force fields. The condition of chemical equilibrium (i.e., equal chemical potential of the salt in the solid and in the solution) is obtained at room temperature and pressure to determine the solubility of the salt. We used the same methodology that was described in our previous work [E. Sanz and C. Vega, J. Chem. Phys.126, 014507 (2007)]10.1063/1.2397683 although several modifications were introduced to improve the accuracy of the calculations. It is found that the predictions of the solubility are quite sensitive to the details of the force field used. Certain force fields underestimate the experimental solubility of NaCl in water by a factor of four, whereas the predictions of other force fields are within 20\% of the experimental value. Direct coexistence molecular dynamic simulations were also performed to determine the solubility of the salt. Reasonable agreement was found between the solubility obtained from free energy calculations and that obtained from direct coexistence simulations. This work shows that the evaluation of the solubility of salts in water can now be performed in computer simulations. The solubility depends on the ion-ion, ion-water, and water-water interactions. For this reason, the prediction of the solubility can be quite useful in future work to develop force fields for ions in water.},

  Abstract                 = {Configurational-bias Monte Carlo simulations in the Gibbs ensemble (CBMC-GE) are used to investigate the adsorption of both linear and branched alkanes (ethane, propane, n-butane, and 2-methylpropane) from dilute solutions in liquid methane onto a carbon slit pore at T = 160 K and at either the saturation pressure or pext = 100 atm. Thermodynamic properties (adsorption isotherms, selectivities, and Henry's law constants) and structural properties (density and orientational distributions) are presented. Both the Henry's law constants and the separation factors depend exponentially on the number of carbon atoms for the linear alkanes, whereas chain branching and higher pressure lead to a reduction of these properties. The solute density profiles show oscillatory behavior along the surface normal, and peaks in the number density are correlated with a preference for parallel orientations. The CBMC-GE approach allows for the efficient calculation of these selective adsorption phenomena, and data for multiple solutes (in the dilute regime) can be extracted from a single simulation.},

  Abstract                 = {In the recent SAMPL5 challenge, participants submitted predictions for cyclohexane/water distribution coefficients for a set of 53 small molecules. Distribution coefficients (log D) replace the hydration free energies that were a central part of the past five SAMPL challenges. A wide variety of computational methods were represented by the 76 submissions from 18 participating groups. Here, we analyze submissions by a variety of error metrics and provide details for a number of reference calculations we performed. As in the SAMPL4 challenge, we assessed the ability of participants to evaluate not just their statistical uncertainty, but their model uncertainty-how well they can predict the magnitude of their model or force field error for specific predictions. Unfortunately, this remains an area where prediction and analysis need improvement. In SAMPL4 the top performing submissions achieved a root-mean-squared error (RMSE) around 1.5 kcal/mol. If we anticipate accuracy in log D predictions to be similar to the hydration free energy predictions in SAMPL4, the expected error here would be around 1.54 log units. Only a few submissions had an RMSE below 2.5 log units in their predicted log D values. However, distribution coefficients introduced complexities not present in past SAMPL challenges, including tautomer enumeration, that are likely to be important in predicting biomolecular properties of interest to drug discovery, therefore some decrease in accuracy would be expected. Overall, the SAMPL5 distribution coefficient challenge provided great insight into the importance of modeling a variety of physical effects. We believe these types of measurements will be a promising source of data for future blind challenges, especially in view of the relatively straightforward nature of the experiments and the level of insight provided.},

  Abstract                 = {An approach to searching for extraterrestrial life on the base of ``autotroph'' concept of the origin of life is presented in the paper. According to this concept the origin of life took place in three stages. The first stage was developed inside the global geochemical cycle in which the turnover of different chemical transformations was implemented by solar radiation and/or heat energy of bowels of the Earth. At the second stage, after the autocatalytic systems have emerged these systems evolved as a result of ``natural selection'' by autocatalysis parameters up to emergence of special inheritance systems that drastically improved the autocatalysis parameters. The best in terms of autocatalysis parameters were the autocatalysis systems based on phase-separated particles where complex structures can form not only on the basis of covalent interactions. Such autocatalysis systems can emerge only in liquid in a certain range of temperatures and pressures. At this stage the geochemical cycle complicated involving new substances. At the third stage the evolution involved improvement of inheritance systems resulting in formation of the modern type of genetic apparatus. This concept formed the basis to consider approaches to experimental modeling of major aspects of the origin of life and to outlining some general features of life that can extend the sensitive horizon of searching for extraterrestrial life.},

  Abstract                 = {[Figure: see text]. Most chemical processes on earth are intimately linked to the unique properties of water, relying on the versatility with which water interacts with molecules of varying sizes and polarities. These interactions determine everything from the structure and activity of proteins and living cells to the geological partitioning of water, oil, and minerals in the Earth's crust. The role of hydrophobic hydration in the formation of biological membranes and in protein folding, as well as the importance of electrostatic interactions in the hydration of polar and ionic species, are all well known. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of hydration are often not as well understood. This Account summarizes and extends emerging understandings of these mechanisms to reveal a newly unified view of hydration and explain previously mystifying observations. For example, rare gas atoms (e.g., Ar) and alkali-halide ions (e.g., K+ and Cl-) have nearly identical experimental hydration entropies, despite the significant charge-induced reorganization of water molecules. Here, we explain how such previously mysterious observations may be understood as arising from Gibbs inequalities, which impose rigorous energetic upper and lower bounds on both hydration free energies and entropies. These fundamental Gibbs bounds depend only on the average interaction energy of a solute with water, thus providing a deep link between solute-water interaction energies and entropies. One of the surprising consequences of the emerging picture is the understanding that the hydration of an ion produces two large but nearly perfectly cancelling, entropic contributions: a negative ion-water interaction entropy and a positive water reorganization entropy. Recent work has also clarified the relationship between the strong cohesive energy of water and the free energy required to form an empty hole (cavity) in water. Here, we explain how linear response theory (whose roots may also be traced to Gibbs inequalities) can provide remarkably accurate descriptions of the process of filling aqueous cavities with nonpolar, polar, or charged molecules. The hydration of nonpolar molecules is well-described by first-order perturbation theory, which implies that turning on solute-water van der Waals interactions does not induce a significant change in water structure. The larger changes in water structure that are induced by polar and ionic solutes are well-described by second-order perturbation theory, which is equivalent to linear response theory. Comparisons of the free energies of nonpolar and polar or ionic solutes may be used to experimentally determine electrostatic contributions to water reorganization energies and entropies. The success of this approach implies that water's ability to respond to solutes of various polarities is far from saturated, as illustrated by simulations of acetonitrile (CH 3CN) in water, which reveal that even such a strongly dipolar solute only produces subtle changes in the structure of water.},

Phys. 136, 244508 (2012)] has been used, except, that all calculations for the NaCl in solution were obtained by using molecular dynamics simulations with the GROMACS package instead of homemade MC programs. We have explored new lower molalities and made longer runs to improve the accuracy of the calculations. Exploring the low molality region allowed us to obtain an analytical expression for the chemical potential of the ions in solution as a function of molality valid for a wider range of molalities, including the infinite dilute case. These new results are in better agreement with recent estimations of the solubility obtained with other methodologies. Besides, two empirical simple rules have been obtained to have a rough estimate of the solubility of a certain model, by analyzing the ionic pairs formation as a function of molality and/or by calculating the difference between the NaCl solidchemical potential and the standard chemical potential of the salt in solution.},

The estimation strategy depends on the extent of overlap between the two ensembles, on the smoothness of the density-of-states as a function of the difference potential, and on the relative Monte Carlo sampling costs, per statistically independent data point. The best estimate of the free energy difference is usually obtained by dividing the available computer time approximately equally between the two ensembles; its efficiency (variance x computer time)-1 is never less, and may be several orders of magnitude greater, than that obtained by sampling only one ensemble, as is done in perturbation theory.},

  Abstract                 = {In a recent article (Bieler et al., J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2014, 10, 3006), we introduced a combination of λ-dynamics and local-elevation umbrella-sampling termed λ-LEUS to calculate free-energy changes associated with alchemical processes using molecular dynamics simulations. This method was suggested to be more efficient than thermodynamic integration (TI), because the dynamical variation of the alchemical variable λ opens up pathways to circumvent barriers in the orthogonal space (defined by the N -- 1 degrees of freedom that are not subjected to the sampling enhancement), a feature λ-LEUS shares with Hamiltonian replica-exchange (HR) approaches. However, the mutation considered, hydroquinone to benzene in water, was no real challenge in terms of orthogonal-space properties, which were restricted to solvent-relaxation processes. In the present article, we revisit the comparison between TI and λ-LEUS considering non-trivial mutations of the central residue X of a KXK tripeptide in water (with X = G, E, K, S, F, or Y). Side-chain interactions that may include salt bridges, hydrogen bonds or steric clashes lead to slow relaxation in the orthogonal space, mainly in the two-dimensional subspace spanned by the central φ and ψ dihedral angles of the peptide. The efficiency enhancement afforded by λ-LEUS is confirmed in this more complex test system and can be attributed explicitly to the improved sampling of the orthogonal space. The sensitivity of the results to the nontrivial choices of a mass parameter and of a thermostat coupling time for the alchemical variable is also investigated, resulting in recommended ranges of 50 to 100 u nm2 and 0.2 to 0.5 ps, respectively. {\copyright} 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  Abstract                 = { The role of the bonded (bond stretching and bond angle) force-field terms in free energy simulations is examined. It is shown that the proper treatment of such terms depends on the choice of the free energy methodology (single or dual topology). Furthermore, while there are no problems in describing changes in bonded terms, care has to be used in creating or destroying them in a molecular dynamics simulation. An approach that avoids the singularity caused by a bond with a zero force constant is outlined. Changes in bond stretching or bond angle terms are shown to give rise to vibrational, Jacobian factor, and potential-of-mean-force-type (pmf) contributions. The meaning of bond stretching and bond angle bending free energy components obtained in single and dual topology simulations and their connection to these three contributions is investigated. Due to the different end states used in single and dual topology simulations, the pmf contribution is projected on different free energy components. In certain dual topology methods, vibrational and Jacobian factor contributions are not included in the free energy difference. Therefore, single free energy differences (e.g., the free energy difference between two molecules in the gas phase and in solution) often cannot be compared directly between single and dual topology methods. However, identical double free energy differences (e.g., free energy differences of solvation) are obtained in all cases. The present analysis emphasizes the importance of the details of the simulation methodology in interpreting the results for bonded terms and reconciles apparently contradictory findings in the literature. },

  Abstract                 = { Calculations of the free energy difference of solvation are used to study the contributions arising from alchemical changes of bond stretching and angle bending energy terms in the force field. The results illustrate the theoretical analysis of such terms given in the companion paper (Boresch, S.; Karplus, M. The Role of Bonded Terms in Free Energy Simulations:  1. Theoretical Analysis. J. Phys. Chem. A 1998, 103, 10310). Three model systems are investigated:  (a) two one-dimensional harmonic oscillators interacting with a third particle that represents the solvent, (b) the aqueous solvation of two diatomic molecules, and (c) the aqueous solvation of ethane and methanol. In each case, the computations are carried out with both a single topology and a dual topology methodology. A comparison of free energy components of the single and double free energy differences obtained in the calculations makes it possible to identify the three contributions that the theoretical analysis showed were involved, i.e., vibrational, pmf-type, and Jacobian factor terms.The verification of the theoretical analysis by illustrative examples provides the basis for addressing the question of whether the so-called self-terms can make significant contributions to double free energy differences. This is accomplished by identifying the effect of coupling of the three contributions from bonded energy terms on a double free energy difference. For the model systems studied, coupling and, hence, self-terms are found to be of little importance. The analysis resolves the ambiguities concerning this issue in the literature. },

  Abstract                 = { The computation of absolute binding affinities by molecular dynamics (MD) based free energy simulations is analyzed, and an exact method to carry out such a computation is presented. The key to obtaining converged results is the introduction of suitable, auxiliary restraints to prevent the ligand from leaving the binding site when the native ligand−receptor interactions are turned off alchemically. We describe a versatile set of restraints that (i) can be used in MD simulations, that (ii) restricts both the position and the orientation of the ligand, and that (iii) is defined relative to the receptor rather than relative to a fixed point in space. The free energy cost, ΔAr, for this set of restraints can be evaluated analytically. Although the techniques were originally developed for the gas phase, the resulting expression is exact, since all contributions from solute−solvent interactions cancel from the final result. The value of ΔAr depends only on the equilibrium values and force constants of the chosen harmonic restraint terms and, therefore, can be easily calculated. The standard state dependence of binding free energies is also investigated, and it is shown that the present approach takes this into account correctly. The analytical expression for ΔAr is verified numerically by calculations on the complex formed by benzene with the L99A mutant of T4 lysozyme. The overall approach is illustrated by a complete binding free energy calculation for a complex based on a simplified model for tyrosine bound to tyrosyl-tRNA-synthetase. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed set of restraints and confirm that the calculated binding free energy is independent of the details of the restraints. Comparisons are made with earlier formulations for the calculation of binding free energies, and certain limitations of that work are described. The relationship between ΔAr and the loss of translational and rotational entropy during a binding process is analyzed. },

Three sets of predictions were submitted, each based on different variations of classical molecular dynamics alchemical free energy calculation protocols based on the double annihilation method. The first model (model A) yields a free energy of binding based on computed free energy changes in solvated and host-guest complex phases; the second (model B) adds long range dispersion corrections to the previous result; the third (model C) uses an additional standard state correction term to account for the use of distance restraints during the molecular dynamics simulations.

  Abstract                 = {In the context of the SAMPL5 challenge water-cyclohexane distribution coefficients for 53 drug-like molecules were predicted. Four different models based on molecular dynamics free energy calculations were tested. All models initially assumed only one chemical state present in aqueous or organic phases. Model A is based on results from an alchemical annihilation scheme; model B adds a long range correction for the Lennard Jones potentials to model A; model C adds charging free energy corrections; model D applies the charging correction from model C to ionizable species only. Model A and B perform better in terms of mean-unsigned error ( {\$}{\$}{\backslash}hbox {\{}MUE{\}}=6.79<6.87<6.95 {\backslash}log{\$}{\$} MUE = 6.79 < 6.87 < 6.95 log D units ~ 95�{\%} confidence interval) and determination coefficient {\$}{\$}({\backslash}hbox {\{}R{\}}^2 = 0.26< 0.27< 0.28){\$}{\$} ( R 2 = 0.26 < 0.27 < 0.28 ) , while charging corrections lead to poorer results with model D ( {\$}{\$}{\backslash}hbox {\{}MUE{\}}=12.8<12.63<12.98{\$}{\$} MUE = 12.8 < 12.63 < 12.98 and {\$}{\$}{\backslash}hbox {\{}R{\}}^2 = 0.16<0.17<0.18{\$}{\$} R 2 = 0.16 < 0.17 < 0.18 ). Because overall errors were large, a retrospective analysis that allowed co-existence of ionisable and neutral species of a molecule in aqueous phase was investigated. This considerably reduced systematic errors ( {\$}{\$}{\backslash}hbox {\{}MUE{\}}=1.87<1.97<2.07{\$}{\$} MUE = 1.87 < 1.97 < 2.07 and {\$}{\$}{\backslash}hbox {\{}R{\}}^2 = 0.35<0.40<0.45{\$}{\$} R 2 = 0.35 < 0.40 < 0.45 ). Overall accurate {\$}{\$}{\backslash}log D{\$}{\$} log D predictions for drug-like molecules that may adopt multiple tautomers and charge states proved difficult, indicating a need for methodological advances to enable satisfactory treatment by explicit-solvent molecular simulations.},

  Abstract                 = {This chapter gives an overview of some different methods for calculating ligand binding free energies that are all based on force fields and conformational sampling. Many of these studies of protein--ligand binding in the mid-1980s showed a remarkable agreement between theory and experiment, which led to an explosion of activity in the field of free energy calculations. More recent investigations, however, have demonstrated that significantly longer simulations than those used in the original reports are often required obtaining reliable results in protein--ligand binding studies. The increasing number of applications of free energy calculations also showed that the use of these methods was not as straightforward as expected; therefore, much effort was spent on improving the methodology. The free energy perturbation (FEP)/thermodynamic integration (TI) type of method has not really fulfilled its promise of being able to open a major new avenue to structure-based drug design due to slow convergence and sampling difficulties. In particular, in this type of extrapolation process in which one may want to look at 20 or so new ligands, arriving at the correct end-points by long perturbation paths sometimes seems hopeless. It appears that a better solution to this problem can often be provided by automated docking of individual compounds, at least when they differ significantly from each other, and then to try to evaluate the binding energetic by a method that does not require the unphysical transformations involved in FEP/TI and related methods. The docking problem resembles the protein-folding one in many respects, and the only way to attack difficult cases seems to be by extensive conformational searching in combination with more reliable scoring methods.},

  Abstract                 = {The well-documented anomalous solubility of beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD), relative to alpha- and gamma-CD, has been examined by Naidoo et al. (J. Phys. Chem. B, 2004, 108, 4236-4238.) from the perspective of water organization and internal motion of the macrocyclic rings. Whether modulation in the hydration patterns and in the rigidity of the molecular scaffold can be reconciled with the hydration free energy of beta-CD to rationalize its notorious low solubility remains open to further investigation. In this contribution, multi-nanosecond molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been carried out to investigate the hydration process of alpha-, beta- and gamma-CD. The distribution of water molecules involved in this process and the linearity of intramolecular hydrogen bonds have been analyzed. The results reported here demonstrate that the anomalous solubility for beta-CD can be essentially rationalized by its greater rigidity conferred by the participating intramolecular hydrogen bonds and the higher density of water molecules of lesser mobility. The hydration free energy of alpha-, beta- and gamma-CD was computed using the free energy perturbation method. This quantity is shown to increase with the number of glucose units, thereby suggesting that the anomalous solubility of beta-CD cannot be explained by its free energy of hydration alone.},

In spite of recent advances on the hardware front that have pushed back the limitations of brute-force molecular dynamics simulations, opening the way to time and size scales hitherto never attained, they represent a cogent alternative to access with unparalleled accuracy the thermodynamics and possibly the kinetics that underlie the complex processes of the cell machinery. From a pragmatic perspective, the present review draws a picture of how the field has been shaped and invigorated by milestone developments, application, and sometimes rediscovery of foundational principles laid down years ago to reach new frontiers in the exploration of intricate biological phenomena. Through a series of illustrative examples, distinguishing between alchemical and geometrical transformations, it discusses how far free-energy calculations have come, what are the current hurdles they have to overcome, and the challenges they are facing for tomorrow.

The methodological milestones paving the road of free energy calculations are summarized, in particular free energy perturbation and thermodynamic integration, in the framework of constrained or unconstrained molecular dynamics. The continuing difficulties encountered when attempting to obtain accurate estimates are discussed with an emphasis on the usefulness of large-scale numerical simulations in non-academic environments, like the world of the pharmaceutical industry. Applications of the free energy arsenal of methods is illustrated through a variety of biologically relevant problems, among which the prediction of protein-ligand binding constants, the determination of membrane-water partition coefficients of small, pharmacologically active compounds --- in connection with the blood-brain barrier, the folding of a short hydrophobic peptide, and the association of transmembrane α-helical domains, in line with the ``two-stage'' model of membrane protein folding. Current strategies for improving the reliability of free energy calculations, while making them somewhat more affordable, and, therefore, more compatible with the constraints of an industrial environment, are outlined.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent calorimetric studies of interactions between small molecules and biomolecular targets have generated renewed interest in the phenomenon of entropy-enthalpy compensation. In these studies, entropic and enthalpic contributions to binding are observed to vary substantially and in an opposing manner as the ligand or protein is modified, whereas the binding free energy varies little. In severe examples, engineered enthalpic gains can lead to completely compensating entropic penalties, frustrating ligand design. Here, we examine the evidence for compensation, as well as its potential origins, prevalence, severity, and ramifications for ligand engineering. We find the evidence for severe compensation to be weak in light of the large magnitude of and correlation between errors in experimental measurements of entropic and enthalpic contributions to binding, though a limited form of compensation may be common. Given the difficulty of predicting or measuring entropic and enthalpic changes to useful precision, or using this information in design, we recommend ligand engineering efforts instead focus on computational and experimental methodologies to directly assess changes in binding free energy.},

Alchemical binding free energy calculations, one potential tool for rational design, have progressed rapidly over the past decade, but still fall short of providing robust tools for pharmaceutical engineering. Recent studies, especially on model receptor systems, have clarified many of the challenges that must be overcome for robust predictions of binding affinity to be useful in rational design. In this review, inspired by a recent joint academic/industry meeting organized by the authors, we discuss these challenges and suggest a number of promising approaches for overcoming them. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {In water, positive ions attract negative ions. That attraction can be modulated if a hydrophobic surface is present near the two ions in water. Using computer simulations with explicit and implicit water, we study how an ion embedded on a hydrophobic surface interacts with another nearby ion in water. Using hydrophobic surfaces with different curvatures, we find that the contact interaction between a positive and negative ion is strongly affected by the curvature of an adjacent surface, either stabilizing or destabilizing the ion pair. We also find that the solvent-separated ion pair (SSIP) can be made more stable than the contacting ion pair by the presence of a surface. This may account for why bridging waters are often found in protein crystal structures. We also note that implicit solvent models do not account for SSIPs. Finally, we find that there are charge asymmetries: an embedded positive charge attracting a negative ion is different than an embedded negative charge attracting a positive ion. Such asymmetries are also not predicted by implicit solvent models. These results may be useful for improving computational models of solvation in biology and chemistry.},

  Abstract                 = {The performance of the extended solvent-contact model has been addressed in the SAMPL5 blind prediction challenge for distribution coefficient (LogD) of drug-like molecules with respect to the cyclohexane/water partitioning system. All the atomic parameters defined for 41 atom types in the solvation free energy function were optimized by operating a standard genetic algorithm with respect to water and cyclohexane solvents. In the parameterizations for cyclohexane, the experimental solvation free energy (ΔG sol ) data of 15 molecules for 1-octanol were combined with those of 77 molecules for cyclohexane to construct a training set because ΔG sol values of the former were unavailable for cyclohexane in publicly accessible databases. Using this hybrid training set, we established the LogD prediction model with the correlation coefficient (R), average error (AE), and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.55, 1.53, and 3.03, respectively, for the comparison of experimental and computational results for 53 SAMPL5 molecules. The modest accuracy in LogD prediction could be attributed to the incomplete optimization of atomic solvation parameters for cyclohexane. With respect to 31 SAMPL5 molecules containing the atom types for which experimental reference data for ΔG sol were available for both water and cyclohexane, the accuracy in LogD prediction increased remarkably with the R, AE, and RMSE values of 0.82, 0.89, and 1.60, respectively. This significant enhancement in performance stemmed from the better optimization of atomic solvation parameters by limiting the element of training set to the molecules with experimental ΔG sol data for cyclohexane. Due to the simplicity in model building and to low computational cost for parameterizations, the extended solvent-contact model is anticipated to serve as a valuable computational tool for LogD prediction upon the enrichment of experimental ΔG sol data for organic solvents.},

The SM8 model may be combined with density functional theory or Hartree--Fock theory to describe a solute's electronic structure and its self-consistent-field polarization by a solvent. A key feature is the use of class IV charge models to obtain accurate charge distributions (either in the vapor phase or in solution), even when using small basis sets that are affordable for large systems. A second key feature is that nonelectrostatic effects due to cavity formation, dispersion interactions, and changes in solvent structure are included in terms of empirical atomic surface tensions that depend on geometry but do not require atom-type assignments by the user. Use of an analytic surface area algorithm provides very stable energy gradients that allow geometry optimization in solution. The SM8 continuum model, the culmination of a series of SMx models (x = 1--8), permits the modeling of such diverse media as aqueous and organic solvents, soils, lipid bilayers, and air--water interfaces. In addition to predicting accurate transfer free energies between gaseous and condensed phases or between two different condensed phases, SMx models have been useful for predicting the significant influence of condensed phases on processes associated with a change in molecular charge, including acid/base equilibria and oxidation/reduction processes. In this Account, we provide an overview of the algorithms associated with the computation of free energies of solvation in the SM8 model. We also compare the accuracies of the SM8 model with those of other continuum solvation models. Finally, we highlight applications of the SM8 models to compute ionic solvation free energies, oxidation and reduction potentials, and pKa values.},

  Abstract                 = {Enthalpy of mixing (EOM) is one of the most basic thermodynamic properties of mixtures. To assess feasibility of predicting EOM using force field simulation methods, fifteen (15) representative binary mixtures were investigated using MD simulations based on OPLS and TIP4P force fields. The simulation conditions and errors were carefully examined. The precision level of 0.04 kJ/mol was obtained for calculated EOM data. However, the predictions, measured by deviations from experimental data, were only qualitatively correct. Among various factors influencing the accuracy of predictions, force field quality representing interactions among different molecules plays the most significant role. Using methanol/benzene and ethanol/benzene as examples, we demonstrated that non-additive interaction terms between polarizable atoms can be used to significantly improve the quality of predictions. In addition, it appears that charge-dependent LJ parameters are required in order to represent the polarization effects accurately. {\copyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {Solvation is a fundamental contribution in many biological processes and especially in molecular binding. Its estimation can be performed by means of several computational approaches. The aim of this review is to give an overview of existing theories and methods to estimate solvent effects giving a specific focus on the category of implicit solvent models and their use in Molecular Dynamics. In many of these models, the solvent is considered as a continuum homogenous medium, while the solute can be represented at the atomic detail and at different levels of theory. Despite their degree of approximation, implicit methods are still widely employed due to their trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Their derivation is rooted in the statistical mechanics and integral equations disciplines, some of the related details being provided here. Finally, methods that combine implicit solvent models and molecular dynamics simulation, are briefly described.},

  Abstract                 = {An increasing number of studies have reported computations of the absolute binding free energy of small ligands to proteins using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with results that are in good agreement with experiments. This encouraging progress suggests that physics-based approaches hold the promise of making important contributions to the process of drug discovery and optimization in the near future. Two types of approaches are principally used to compute binding free energies with MD simulations. The most widely known are based on alchemical free energy methods, in which the interaction of the ligand with its surrounding are progressively switched off. An alternative method is to use a potential of mean force (PMF), in which the ligand is physically separated from the protein receptor. For both of these computational approaches, restraining potentials affecting the translational, rotational and conformational freedom of the ligand and protein may be activated and released during the simulations to aid convergence and improve the sampling. Such restraining potentials add bias to the simulations, but their effects can be rigorously removed to yield a binding free energy that is properly unbiased with respect to the standard state. A review of recent results is presented. Examples of computations with T4-lysozyme mutants, FKBP12, SH2 domain, and cytochrome P450 are discussed and compared. Differences in computational methods are discussed and remaining difficulties and challenges are highlighted.},

  Abstract                 = { Solvation free energies can now be calculated precisely from molecular simulations, providing a valuable test of the energy functions underlying these simulations. Here we briefly review “alchemical” approaches for calculating the solvation free energies of small, neutral organic molecules from molecular simulations and illustrate these approaches by applying them to calculate aqueous solvation free energies (hydration free energies). These approaches use a nonphysical pathway to compute free energy differences from a simulation or set of simulations and appear to be a particularly robust and general-purpose approach for this task. We also present an update (version 0.5) to our FreeSolv database of experimental and calculated hydration free energies of neutral compounds and provide input files in formats for several simulation packages. This revision to FreeSolv provides calculated values generated with a single protocol and software version rather than the heterogeneous protocols used in the prior version of the database. We also further update the database to provide calculated enthalpies and entropies of hydration and some experimental enthalpies and entropies as well as electrostatic and nonpolar components of solvation free energies. },

It is based on a layered architecture: the lower layers function as a reusable library that can be invoked by any application, while the upper layers form a complete environment for running molecular simulations. The library API hides all hardware-specific dependencies and optimizations from the users and developers of simulation programs: they can be run without modification on any hardware on which the API has been implemented. The current implementations of OpenMM include support for graphics processing units using the OpenCL and CUDA frameworks. In addition, OpenMM was designed to be extensible, so new hardware architectures can be accommodated and new functionality (e.g., energy terms and integrators) can be easily added. },

SEA water captures much of the physics of explicit-solvent models but with computational speeds approaching those of implicit-solvent models. We use an explicit-water model to precompute properties of water solvation shells around simple spheres, then assemble a solute's solvation shell by combining the shells of these spheres. SEA improves upon implicit-solvent models of solvation free energies by accounting for local solute curvature, accounting for near-neighbor nonadditivities, and treating water's dipole as being asymmetrical with respect to positive or negative solute charges. SEA does not involve parameter fitting, because parameters come from the given underlying explicit-solvation model. SEA is about as accurate as explicit simulations as shown by comparisons against four different homologous alkyl series, a set of 504 varied solutes, solutes taken retrospectively from two solvation-prediction events, and a hypothetical polar-solute series, and SEA is about 100-fold faster than Poisson-Boltzmann calculations.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a simple optimization strategy for incorporating experimental dielectric response information on neat liquids in classical molecular models of alcohol. Using this strategy, we determine simple and transferable hydroxyl modulation rules that, when applied to an existing molecular parameter set, result in a newly dielectric corrected (DC) parameter set. We applied these rules to the general Amber force field (GAFF) to form an initial set of GAFF-DC parameters, and we found this to lead to significant improvement in the calculated dielectric constant and hydration free energy values for a wide variety of small molecule alcohol models. Tests of the GAFF-DC parameters in the SAMPL4 blind prediction event for hydration show these changes improve agreement with experiment. Surprisingly, these simple modifications also outperform detailed quantum mechanical electric field calculations using a self-consistent reaction field environment coupling term. This work provides a potential benchmark for future developments in methods for representing condensed-phase environments in electronic structure calculations.},

The interpretation of the behavior of these systems under pressure is somewhat controversial when the attempt is made to connect the hydrocarbon model with the folding-unfolding of proteins under pressure. We consider the free energy of solubility of non-polar substances in water by molecular dynamics simulation to compute changes in the free energy of transference of a Lennard-Jones particle to an existent cluster of such particles in water from 1 to1500 bar and 300 ?? 4 K. The critical cluster size needed to form an aggregate increase with pressure. Using the values of the free energy of transference, an analytical expression is proposed to describe its behavior. The formation of clusters requires a tetrahedral structure to allow hydrophobic interaction, then, decrease of cluster size is due to the change of water properties under pressure. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.

  Abstract                 = {Predictive modeling of reaction equilibria presents one of the grand challenges in the field of molecular simulation. Difficulties in the study of such systems arise from the need (i) to accurately model both strong, short-ranged interactions leading to the formation of chemical bonds and weak interactions arising from the environment, and (ii) to sample the range of time scales involving frequent molecular collisions, slow diffusion, and infrequent reactive events. Here we present a novel reactive first-principles Monte Carlo (RxFPMC) approach that allows for investigation of reaction equilibria without the need to prespecify a set of chemical reactions and their ideal-gas equilibrium constants. We apply RxFPMC to investigate a nitrogen/oxygen mixture at T = 3000 K and p = 30 GPa, i.e., conditions that are present in atmospheric lightning strikes and explosions. The RxFPMC simulations show that the solvation environment leads to a significantly enhanced NO concentration that reaches a maximum when oxygen is present in slight excess. In addition, the RxFPMC simulations indicate the formation of NO2 and N2O in mole fractions approaching 1\%, whereas N3 and O3 are not observed. The equilibrium distributions obtained from the RxFPMC simulations agree well with those from a thermochemical computer code parametrized to experimental data.},

The computational protocol leveraged docking and high level atomistic models to improve enrichment. The enrichment factor of our blind predictions ranked best among all of the computational submissions, and second best overall. This work represents to our knowledge the first example of the application of an all-atom physics-based binding free energy model to large scale virtual screening. A total of 285 parallel Hamiltonian replica exchange molecular dynamics absolute protein-ligand binding free energy simulations were conducted starting from docked poses. The setup of the simulations was fully automated, calculations were distributed on multiple computing resources and were completed in a 6-weeks period. The accuracy of the docked poses and the inclusion of intramolecular strain and entropic losses in the binding free energy estimates were the major factors behind the success of the method. Lack of sufficient time and computing resources to investigate additional protonation states of the ligands was a major cause of mispredictions. The experiment demonstrated the applicability of binding free energy modeling to improve hit rates in challenging virtual screening of focused ligand libraries during lead optimization.},

Particular emphasis is given to the modeling of conformational reorganization and entropic effect. The methods reviewed are free energy perturbation, double decoupling, the Binding Energy Distribution Analysis Method, the potential of mean force method, mining minima and MM/PBSA.

  Abstract                 = {BEDAM calculations are described to predict the free energies of binding of a series of anaesthetic drugs to a recently characterized acyclic cucurbituril host. The modeling predictions, conducted as part of the SAMPL3 host-guest affinity blind challenge, are generally in good quantitative agreement with the experimental measurements. The correlation coefficient between computed and measured binding free energies is 70\% with high statistical significance. Multiple conformational stereoisomers and protonation states of the guests have been considered. Better agreement is obtained with high statistical confidence under acidic modeling conditions. It is shown that this level of quantitative agreement could have not been reached without taking into account reorganization energy and configurational entropy effects. Extensive conformational variability of the host, the guests and their complexes is observed in the simulations, affecting binding free energy estimates and structural predictions. A conformational reservoir technique is introduced as part of the parallel Hamiltonian replica exchange molecular dynamics BEDAM protocol to fully capture conformational variability. It is shown that these advanced computational strategies lead to converged free energy estimates for these systems, offering the prospect of utilizing host-guest binding free energy data for force field validation and development.},

  Abstract                 = {We have developed an implicit solvent effective potential (AGBNP) that is suitable for molecular dynamics simulations and high-resolution modeling. It is based on a novel implementation of the pairwise descreening Generalized Born model for the electrostatic component and a new nonpolar hydration free energy estimator. The nonpolar term consists of an estimator for the solute-solvent van der Waals dispersion energy designed to mimic the continuum solvent solute-solvent van der Waals interaction energy, in addition to a surface area term corresponding to the work of cavity formation. AGBNP makes use of a new parameter-free algorithm to calculate the scaling coefficients used in the pairwise descreening scheme to take into account atomic overlaps. The same algorithm is also used to calculate atomic surface areas. We show that excellent agreement is achieved for the GB self-energies and surface areas in comparison to accurate, but much more expensive, numerical evaluations. The parameter-free approach used in AGBNP and the sensitivity of the AGBNP model with respect to large and small conformational changes makes the model suitable for high-resolution modeling of protein loops and receptor sites as well as high-resolution prediction of the structure and thermodynamics of protein-ligand complexes. We present illustrative results for these kinds of benchmarks. The model is fully analytical with first derivatives and is computationally efficient. It has been incorporated into the IMPACT molecular simulation program.},

  Abstract                 = {The AGBNP2 implicit solvent model, an evolution of the Analytical Generalized Born plus Non-Polar (AGBNP) model we have previously reported, is presented with the aim of modeling hydration effects beyond those described by conventional continuum dielectric representations. A new empirical hydration free energy component based on a procedure to locate and score hydration sites on the solute surface is introduced to model first solvation shell effects, such as hydrogen bonding, which are poorly described by continuum dielectric models. This new component is added to the Generalized Born and non-polar AGBNP terms. Also newly introduced is an analytical Solvent Excluded Volume (SEV) model which improves the solute volume description by reducing the effect of spurious high-dielectric interstitial spaces present in conventional van der Waals representations. The AGBNP2 model is parametrized and tested with respect to experimental hydration free energies of small molecules and the results of explicit solvent simulations. Modeling the granularity of water is one of the main design principles employed for the the first shell solvation function and the SEV model, by requiring that water locations have a minimum available volume based on the size of a water molecule. It is shown that the new volumetric model produces Born radii and surface areas in good agreement with accurate numerical evaluations of these quantities. The results of molecular dynamics simulations of a series of mini-proteins show that the new model produces conformational ensembles in substantially better agreement with reference explicit solvent ensembles than the original AGBNP model with respect to both structural and energetics measures.},

  Abstract                 = {The fields of rational drug design and protein engineering benefit from accurate free energy calculations based on molecular dynamics simulations. A thermodynamic integration scheme is often used to calculate changes in the free energy of a system by integrating the change of the system's Hamiltonian with respect to a coupling parameter. These methods exploit nonphysical pathways over thermodynamic cycles involving particle introduction and annihilation. Such alchemical transitions require the modification of the classical nonbonded potential energy terms by applying soft-core potential functions to avoid singularity points. In this work, we propose a novel formulation for a soft-core potential to be applied in nonequilibrium free energy calculations that alleviates singularities, numerical instabilities, and additional minima in the potential energy for all combinations of nonbonded interactions at all intermediate alchemical states. The method was validated by application to (a) the free energy calculations of a closed thermodynamic cycle, (b) the mutation influence on protein thermostability, (c) calculations of small ligand solvation free energies, and (d) the estimation of binding free energies of trypsin inhibitors. The results show that the novel soft-core function provides a robust and accurate general purpose solution to alchemical free energy calculations.},

  Abstract                 = {In recent years molecular simulation has emerged as a useful tool to predict physical properties of complex chemical systems. A methodology to estimate the n-hexane/water and 1-octanol/water partition coefficients of environmentally relevant solutes, namely substituted alkyl-aromatic molecules, chlorobenzenes, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polychlorinated diphenyl ethers (PCDEs) using molecular simulation is elucidated here. The partition coefficients are calculated based on the absolute solvation Gibbs energies in each phase which are estimated from molecular dynamics simulations employing the thermodynamic integration approach. Very encouraging results, with average absolute deviations of 0.4 log P units are presented. Consequently, this molecular-based approach with a strong physical background can provide reliable prediction of the partition coefficients in different solvent pairs without the a priori knowledge of experimental data. {\copyright} 2011 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 58: 1929--1938, 2012},

  Abstract                 = {We present blind predictions submitted to the SAMPL5 challenge on calculating distribution coefficients. The predictions were based on estimating the solvation free energies in water and cyclohexane of the 53 compounds in the challenge. These free energies were computed using alchemical free energy simulations based on a hybrid all-atom/coarse-grained model. The compounds were treated with the general Amber force field, whereas the solvent molecules were treated with the Elba coarse-grained model. Considering the simplicity of the solvent model and that we approximate the distribution coefficient with the partition coefficient of the neutral species, the predictions are of good accuracy. The correlation coefficient, R is 0.64, 82 \% of the predictions have the correct sign and the mean absolute deviation is 1.8 log units. This is on a par with or better than the other simulation-based predictions in the challenge. We present an analysis of the deviations to experiments and compare the predictions to another submission that used all-atom solvent.},

The relationship of the surface area methodology to the volume-integration-based approach of Still and co-workers is elucidated. On the basis of insights obtained from these results, we then develop empirical correction schemes which yield significant improvements in accuracy, as compared to the uncorrected GB model, in reproducing accurate solutions of the Poisson?Boltzmann equation. A large suite of energetic comparisons of GB, corrected S-GB, and PB for multiple conformations of peptides and proteins is presented.},

  Abstract                 = {Although the statistical thermodynamics of noncovalent binding has been considered in a number of theoretical papers, few methods of computing binding affinities are derived explicitly from this underlying theory. This has contributed to uncertainty and controversy in certain areas. This article therefore reviews and extends the connections of some important computational methods with the underlying statistical thermodynamics. A derivation of the standard free energy of binding forms the basis of this review. This derivation should be useful in formulating novel computational methods for predicting binding affinities. It also permits several important points to be established. For example, it is found that the double-annihilation method of computing binding energy does not yield the standard free energy of binding, but can be modified to yield this quantity. The derivation also makes it possible to define clearly the changes in translational, rotational, configurational, and solvent entropy upon binding. It is argued that molecular mass has a negligible effect upon the standard free energy of binding for biomolecular systems, and that the cratic entropy defined by Gurney is not a useful concept. In addition, the use of continuum models of the solvent in binding calculations is reviewed, and a formalism is presented for incorporating a limited number of solvent molecules explicitly.},

  Abstract                 = {It appears plausible that natural selection constrains, to some extent at least, the stability in many natural proteins. If, during protein evolution, stability fluctuates within a comparatively narrow range, then mutations are expected to be fixed with frequencies that reflect mutational effects on stability. Indeed, we recently reported a robust correlation between the effect of 27 conservative mutations on the thermodynamic stability (unfolding free energy) of Escherichia coli thioredoxin and the frequencies of residues occurrences in sequence alignments. We show here that this correlation likely implies a lower limit to thermodynamic stability of only a few kJ/mol below the unfolding free energy of the wild-type (WT) protein. We suggest, therefore, that the correlation does not reflect natural selection of thermodynamic stability by itself, but of some other factor which is linked to thermodynamic stability for the mutations under study. We propose that this other factor is the kinetic stability of thioredoxin in vivo, since( i) kinetic stability relates to irreversible denaturation, (ii) the rate of irreversible denaturation in a crowded cellular environment (or in a harsh extracellular environment) is probably determined by the rate of unfolding, and (iii) the half-life for unfolding changes in an exponential manner with activation free energy and, consequently, comparatively small free energy effects can have deleterious consequences for kinetic stability. This proposal is supported by the results of a kinetic study of the WT form and the 27 single-mutant variants of E. coli thioredoxin based on the global analyses of chevron plots and equilibrium unfolding profiles determined from double-jump unfolding assays. This kinetic study suggests, furthermore, one of the factors that may contribute to the high activation free energy for unfolding in thioredoxin (required for kinetic stability), namely the energetic optimization of native-state residue environments in regions, which become disrupted in the transition state for unfolding.},

The generality of approach is demonstrated by considering a range of applications for small molecules and macromolecules. We also present a very complete statistical analysis of grid errors, and show that the accuracy of our Gaussian-based method is improved over standard techniques.

The chemical and physical processes associated with SOA formation are complex and varied, and, despite considerable progress in recent years, a quantitative and predictive understanding of SOA formation does not exist and therefore represents a major research challenge in atmospheric science. This review begins with an update on the current state of knowledge on the global SOA budget and is followed by an overview of the atmospheric degradation mechanisms for SOA precursors, gas-particle partitioning theory and the analytical techniques used to determine the chemical composition of SOA. A survey of recent laboratory, field and modeling studies is also presented. The following topical and emerging issues are highlighted and discussed in detail: molecular characterization of biogenic SOA constituents, condensed phase reactions and oligomerization, the interaction of atmospheric organic components with sulfuric acid, the chemical and photochemical processing of organics in the atmospheric aqueous phase, aerosol formation from real plant emissions, interaction of atmospheric organic components with water, thermodynamics and mixtures in atmospheric models. Finally, the major challenges ahead in laboratory, field and modeling studies of SOA are discussed and recommendations for future research directions are proposed.},

  Abstract                 = {Anionic states of nucleic acid bases are suspected to play a role in the radiation damage processes of DNA. Our recent studies suggested that the excess electron attachment to the nucleic acid bases can stabilize some rare tautomers, i.e. imine-enamine tautomers and other tautomers with a proton being transferred from nitrogen sites to carbon sites (with respect to the canonical tautomer). So far, these new anionic tautomers have been characterized by the gas-phase electronic structure calculations and photoelectron spectroscopy experiments. In the current contribution we explore the effect of water solvation on the stability of the new anionic tautomers of uracil. The accurate free energies of solvation are calculated in a two step approach. The major contribution was calculated using the classical free-energy perturbation adiabatic-charging approach, where it is assumed that the solvated molecule has the charge distribution given by the polarizable continuum model. In the second step the free energy of solvation is refined by taking into account the real, average solvent charge distribution. This is done using our accelerated QM/MM simulations, where the QM energy of the solute is calculated in the mean potential averaged over many MD steps. We found that in water solution three of the recently identified anionic tautomers are 6.5-3.6 kcal mol(-1) more stable than the anion of the canonical tautomer.},

  Abstract                 = {The solvation free energy of a molecule includes the free energy required to remove solvent from what will become the molecular interior and the free energy gained from dispersive interactions between the solute and solvent. Traditionally, these free energies have been assumed to be proportional to the surface area of the molecule. However, we computed these free energies for a series of alkanes and four configurations of decaalanine and showed that although these free energies were linear in the surface area for each set of molecules, each atom's contributions to these energies depended on correlations with its surrounding atoms. The atomic contributions to these energies were therefore not additive. This finding suggests that most current hydrophobic models are unsatisfactory., Inserting an uncharged van der Waals (vdw) cavity into water disrupts the distribution of water and creates attractive dispersion interactions between the solvent and solute. This free-energy change is the hydrophobic solvation energy (ΔGvdw). Frequently, it is assumed to be linear in the solvent-accessible surface area, with a positive surface tension (γ) that is independent of the properties of the molecule. However, we found that γ for a set of alkanes differed from that for four configurations of decaalanine, and γ = −5 was negative for the decaalanines. These findings conflict with the notion that ΔGvdw favors smaller A. We broke ΔGvdw into the free energy required to exclude water from the vdw cavity (ΔGrep) and the free energy of forming the attractive interactions between the solute and solvent (ΔGatt) and found that γ {\textless} 0 for the decaalanines because −γatt {\textgreater} γrep and γatt {\textless} 0. Additionally, γatt and γrep for the alkanes differed from those for the decaalanines, implying that none of ΔGatt, ΔGrep, and ΔGvdw can be computed with a constant surface tension. We also showed that ΔGatt could not be computed from either the initial or final water distributions, implying that this quantity is more difficult to compute than is sometimes assumed. Finally, we showed that each atom's contribution to γrep depended on multibody interactions with its surrounding atoms, implying that these contributions are not additive. These findings call into question some hydrophobic models.},

  Abstract                 = {Obtaining knowledge of the mutual miscibility of alkanes, surfactants, and water over a wide range of temperatures and pressures is of great relevance for the energy industry. Molecular simulations using advanced sampling techniques and transferable force fields can serve as a predictive method to study a variety of phase equilibria at different temperatures, pressures, and overall compositions. In this work, configurational-bias Monte Carlo simulations in the NpT Gibbs ensemble with the Transferable Potentials for Phase Equilibria (TraPPE) force field are applied to investigate the binary mixture of n-dodecane and ethanol at pressures of 0.1 and 100 MPa and the ternary mixture of these compounds with water at one state point. The simulations qualitatively reproduce the increase of the upper critical solution temperature (UCST) with increasing pressure, but the miscibility gap is overestimated at both pressures and the UCSTs are shifted up by about 50 K compared to the experimental values. The TraPPE model correctly shows a gradual decrease for the ethanol solubility in the n-dodecane-rich phase upon addition of water to the mixture.},

In the present work, we explore the effect that the ordering of natural selection and population regulation in the life cycle has on the resulting population dynamics under the Wright-Fisher model, especially for the evolution of one- and two-locus systems. With weak natural selection, the details of how to order natural selection and population regulation in the life cycle do not matter in the Wright-Fisher model and its diffusion approximation. By contrast, we show that when there is strong natural selection and the population is in linkage disequilibrium, there can be appreciable differences in the resulting population dynamics under the Wright-Fisher model, depending on whether natural selection occurs before or after population regulation in the life cycle. We argue that this effect may be of significance in natural populations subject to gene migration and local selection.},

In this sense, we show that genetic algorithms can be employed to increase the fidelity and optimize the resource requirements of digital quantum simulation protocols, while adapting naturally to the experimental constraints. Furthermore, this method allows us to reduce not only digital errors, but also experimental errors in quantum gates. Indeed, by adding ancillary qubits, we design a modular gate made out of imperfect gates, whose fidelity is larger than the fidelity of any of the constituent gates. Finally, we prove that the proposed modular gates are resilient against different gate errors.},

  Abstract                 = {We present an extensive study on hydration thermodynamic properties of analogues of 13 amino acid side chains at 298 K and 1 atm. The hydration free energies DeltaG, entropies DeltaS, enthalpies DeltaH, and heat capacities Deltac(P)() were determined for 10 combinations of force fields and water models. The statistical sampling was extended such that precisions of 0.3, 0.8, 0.8 kJ/mol and 25 J/(mol K) were reached for DeltaG, TDeltaS, DeltaH, and Deltac(P)(), respectively. The three force fields used in this study are AMBER99, GROMOS 53A6, and OPLS-AA; the five water models are SPC, SPC/E, TIP3P, TIP4P, and TIP4P-Ew. We found that the choice of water model strongly influences the accuracy of the calculated hydration entropies, enthalpies, and heat capacities, while differences in accuracy between the force fields are small. On the basis of an analysis of the hydrophobic analogues of the amino acid side chains, we discuss what properties of the water models are responsible for the observed discrepancies between computed and experimental values. The SPC/E water model performs best with all three biomolecular force fields.},

  Abstract                 = {Methylamine is an abundant amine compound detected in the atmosphere which can affect the nature of atmospheric aerosol surfaces, changing their chemical and optical properties. Molecular dynamics simulation results show that methylamine accommodation on water is close to unity with the hydrophilic head group solvated in the interfacial environment and the methyl group pointing into the air phase. A detailed analysis of the hydrogen bond network indicates stronger hydrogen bonds between water and the primary amine group at the interface, suggesting that atmospheric trace gases will likely react with the methyl group instead of the solvated amine site. These findings suggest new chemical pathways for methylamine acting on atmospheric aerosols in which the methyl group is the site of orientation specific chemistry involving its conversion into a carbonyl site providing hydrophilic groups for uptake of additional water. This conversion may explain the tendency of aged organic aerosols to form cloud condensation nuclei. At the same time, formation of NH2 radical and formaldehyde is suggested to be a new source for NH2 radicals at aerosol surfaces, other than by reaction of absorbed NH3. The results have general implications for the chemistry of other amphiphilic organics, amines in particular, at the surface of atmospherically relevant aerosols.},

Using high precision simulations, and careful application of standard analytical corrections, we show that the new TIP4P-Ew potential has a density maximum at $\sim$1$\mkern1mu^\circ$C, and reproduces experimental bulk-densities and the enthalpy of vaporization, $\Delta$Hvap,$\Delta$Hvap, from -37.5 to 127$\mkern1mu^\circ$C at 1 atm with an absolute average error of less than 1\%. Structural properties are in very good agreement with x-ray scattering intensities at temperatures between 0 and 77$\mkern1mu^\circ$C and dynamical properties such as self-diffusion coefficient are in excellent agreement with experiment. The parameterization approach used can be easily generalized to rehabilitate any water force field using available experimental data over a range of thermodynamic points.},

The mixture models are based on the modified Lorentz--Berthelot combining rule that contains one binary interaction parameter which is adjusted to the Henry's law constant at one temperature or, in preceding work, to the binary system vapor pressure. The predictions from the molecular models of the 95 binary mixtures are compared to available experimental data. In most cases, the molecular models yield good predictions for the gas solubility. It is found that the models are generally capable of yielding reliable data both at infinite dilution and at finite mole fractions.},

  Abstract                 = {The Jarzynski identity can be applied to instances when a microscopic system is pulled repeatedly but quickly along some coordinate, allowing the calculation of an equilibrium free energy profile along the pulling coordinate from a set of independent non-equilibrium trajectories. Using the formalism of Wiener stochastic path integrals in which we assign temperature-dependent weights to Langevin trajectories, we derive exact formulae for the temperature derivatives of the free energy profile. This leads naturally to analytical expressions for decomposing a free energy profile into equilibrium entropy and internal energy profiles from non-equilibrium pulling. This decomposition can be done from trajectories evolved at a unique temperature without repeating the measurement as done in finite-difference decompositions. Three distinct analytical expressions for the entropy-energy decomposition are derived: using a time-dependent generalization of the weighted histogram analysis method, a quasi-harmonic spring limit, and a Feynman-Kac formula. The three novel formulae of reconstructing the pair of entropy-energy profiles are exemplified by Langevin simulations of a two-dimensional model system prototypical for force-induced biomolecular conformational changes. Connections to single-molecule experimental means to probe the functionals needed in the decomposition are suggested.},

  Abstract                 = {Classical Monte Carlo simulations have been carried out for liquid water in the NPT ensemble at 25 $\,^{\circ}$C and 1 atm using six of the simpler intermolecular potential functions for the water dimer: Bernal--Fowler (BF), SPC, ST2, TIPS2, TIP3P, and TIP4P. Comparisons are made with experimental thermodynamic and structural data including the recent neutron diffraction results of Thiessen and Narten. The computed densities and potential energies are in reasonable accord with experiment except for the original BF model, which yields an 18\% overestimate of the density and poor structural results. The TIPS2 and TIP4P potentials yield oxygen--oxygen partial structure functions in good agreement with the neutron diffraction results. The accord with the experimental OH and HH partial structure functions is poorer; however, the computed results for these functions are similar for all the potential functions. Consequently, the discrepancy may be due to the correction terms needed in processing the neutron data or to an effect uniformly neglected in the computations. Comparisons are also made for self--diffusion coefficients obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. Overall, the SPC, ST2, TIPS2, and TIP4P models give reasonable structural and thermodynamic descriptions of liquid water and they should be useful in simulations of aqueous solutions. The simplicity of the SPC, TIPS2, and TIP4P functions is also attractive from a computational standpoint.},

  Abstract                 = { Alchemical transformations are widely used methods to calculate free energies. Amber has traditionally included support for alchemical transformations as part of the sander molecular dynamics (MD) engine. Here, we describe the implementation of a more efficient approach to alchemical transformations in the Amber MD package. Specifically, we have implemented this new approach within the more computationally efficient and scalable pmemd MD engine that is included with the Amber MD package. The majority of the gain in efficiency comes from the improved design of the calculation, which includes better parallel scaling and reduction in the calculation of redundant terms. This new implementation is able to reproduce results from equivalent simulations run with the existing functionality but at 2.5 times greater computational efficiency. This new implementation is also able to run softcore simulations at the λ end states making direct calculation of free energies more accurate, compared to the extrapolation required in the existing implementation. The updated alchemical transformation functionality is planned to be included in the next major release of Amber (scheduled for release in Q1 2014), available at http://ambermd.org, under the Amber license. },

  Abstract                 = {Recently, hidden Markov models have been applied to numerous problems in genomics. Here, we introduce an explicit population genetics hidden Markov model (popGenHMM) that uses single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) frequency data to identify genomic regions that have experienced recent selection. Our popGenHMM assumes that SNP frequencies are emitted independently following diffusion approximation expectations but that neighboring SNP frequencies are partially correlated by selective state. We give results from the training and application of our popGenHMM to a set of early release data from the Drosophila Population Genomics Project (dpgp.org) that consists of approximately 7.8 Mb of resequencing from 32 North American Drosophila melanogaster lines. These results demonstrate the potential utility of our model, making predictions based on the site frequency spectrum (SFS) for regions of the genome that represent selected elements.},

The partition coefficient logP of the neutral species was calculated first and then corrected for dissociation or protonation, as appropriate for acidic or basic solutes, to obtain the cyclohexane-water logD. Using the latest version of the COSMOtherm implementation, this approach in combination with a rigorous conformational sampling yielded a predictive accuracy of 2.11 log units (RMSD) for the 53 compounds of the blind prediction dataset. By that it was the most accurate of all contest submissions and it also achieved the best rank order. The RMSD mainly arises from a group of outliers in the negative logD range, which at least partly may arise from dimerization or other experimental problems coming up for very polar molecules in very non-polar solvents.},

  Abstract                 = {Molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent were applied to predict the hydration free energies for 23 small organic molecules in blind SAMPL2 test. We found good agreement with experimental results, with an RMS error of 2.82 kcal/mol over the whole set and 1.86 kcal/mol over all the molecules except several hydroxyl-rich compounds where we find evidence for a systematic error in the force field. We tested two different solvent models, TIP3P and TIP4P-Ew, and obtained very similar hydration free energies for these two models; the RMS difference was 0.64 kcal/mol. We found that preferred conformation of the carboxylic acids in water differs from that in vacuum. Surprisingly, this conformational change is not adequately sampled on simulation timescales, so we apply an umbrella sampling technique to include free energies associated with the conformational change. Overall, the results of this test reveal that the force field parameters for some groups of molecules (such as hydroxyl-rich compounds) still need to be improved, but for most compounds, accuracy was consistent with that seen in our previous tests.},

  Abstract                 = {Free energy calculations based on molecular dynamics simulations show considerable promise for applications ranging from drug discovery to prediction of physical properties and structure-function studies. But these calculations are still difficult and tedious to analyze, and best practices for analysis are not well defined or propagated. Essentially, each group analyzing these calculations needs to decide how to conduct the analysis and, usually, develop its own analysis tools. Here, we review and recommend best practices for analysis yielding reliable free energies from molecular simulations. Additionally, we provide a Python tool, alchemical-analysis.py , freely available on GitHub as part of the pymbar package (located at http://github.com/choderalab/pymbar ), that implements the analysis practices reviewed here for several reference simulation packages, which can be adapted to handle data from other packages. Both this review and the tool covers analysis of alchemical calculations generally, including free energy estimates via both thermodynamic integration and free energy perturbation-based estimators. Our Python tool also handles output from multiple types of free energy calculations, including expanded ensemble and Hamiltonian replica exchange, as well as standard fixed ensemble calculations. We also survey a range of statistical and graphical ways of assessing the quality of the data and free energy estimates, and provide prototypes of these in our tool. We hope this tool and discussion will serve as a foundation for more standardization of and agreement on best practices for analysis of free energy calculations.},

  Abstract                 = {Implicit solvent models are powerful tools in accounting for the aqueous environment at a fraction of the computational expense of explicit solvent representations. Here, we compare the ability of common implicit solvent models (TC, OBC, OBC2, GBMV, GBMV2, GBSW, GBSW/MS, GBSW/MS2 and FACTS) to reproduce experimental absolute hydration free energies for a series of 499 small neutral molecules that are modeled using AMBER/GAFF parameters and AM1-BCC charges. Given optimized surface tension coefficients for scaling the surface area term in the nonpolar contribution, most implicit solvent models demonstrate reasonable agreement with extensive explicit solvent simulations (average difference 1.0--1.7 kcal/mol and R2 = 0.81--0.91) and with experimental hydration free energies (average unsigned errors = 1.1--1.4 kcal/mol and R2 = 0.66--0.81). Chemical classes of compounds are identified that need further optimization of their ligand force field parameters and others that require improvement in the physical parameters of the implicit solvent models themselves. More sophisticated nonpolar models are also likely necessary to more effectively represent the underlying physics of solvation and take the quality of hydration free energies estimated from implicit solvent models to the next level. {\copyright} 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We emphasize the accuracy and precision of various implementations of the methodology, particularly in the context of the relative effectiveness of `insertion' vs. `deletion' approaches. The study is limited to a single state point and system size. In accord with recent arguments made in the context of the hard-sphere model, we find that any single- or multi-stage approach that incorporates a `deletion' component shows greatly diminished accuracy and precision when compared to its `insertion' counterpart. We also confirm our earlier conjecture that the entropy rather than the freeenergy is the important quantity to examine when formulating optimal multistage free-energyperturbation schemes.},

  Abstract                 = {The presence of solvents is essential in all steps of pharmaceutical processes (reaction, separation, and formulation). For toxicological reasons, drug manufacturers are increasingly required to minimize the number of solvents employed in pharmaceutical processes. In practice, the selection of solvents and antisolvents for pharmaceuticals mostly relies on experience, analogy and experimental testing. Our work aims to systematically investigate the solubility of pharmaceutical compounds and their intermediates in a wide range of solvents. We describe the development of solubility databases of mono- and bifunctional compounds that are based on the core molecular fragments of common drugs and contain substituents of gradually increasing polarity. The core fragments can be identified by a classification of drugs into pharmaceutical categories. Each of the solutes is studied in a series of pharmaceutical solvents of varying polarity and hydrogen bonding tendency. The utility of an example database is shown which uses the benzene ring as the core fragment and contains activity coefficient data of 13 monofunctional benzene derivatives in 17 solvents. The database was analyzed by the Modified UNIFAC (Dortmund) group contribution method and quantum-mechanical/COSMO-RS calculations. The testing shows the importance of polarization effects which are common between drug-like molecules and small polar solvents. The proposed approach can be useful to provide a systematic insight into solvent--solute interactions and for testing of new methods of solubility prediction.},

  Abstract                 = {Integral equation theory of molecular liquids based on statistical mechanics is quite promising as an essential part of multiscale methodology for chemical and biomolecular nanosystems in solution. Beginning with a molecular interaction potential force field, it uses diagrammatic analysis of the solvation free energy to derive integral equations for correlation functions between molecules in solution in the statistical-mechanical ensemble. The infinite chain of coupled integral equations for many-body correlation functions is reduced to a tractable form for 2- or 3-body correlations by applying the so-called closure relations. Solving these equations produces the solvation structure with accuracy comparable to molecular simulations that have converged but has a critical advantage of readily treating the effects and processes spanning over a large space and slow time scales, by far not feasible for explicit solvent molecular simulations. One of the versions of this formalism, the three-dimensional reference interaction site model (3D-RISM) integral equation complemented with the Kovalenko-Hirata (KH) closure approximation, yields the solvation structure in terms of 3D maps of correlation functions, including density distributions, of solvent interaction sites around a solute (supra)molecule with full consistent account for the effects of chemical functionalities of all species in the solution. The solvation free energy and the subsequent thermodynamics are then obtained at once as a simple integral of the 3D correlation functions by performing thermodynamic integration analytically.},

  Abstract                 = {The solubility of drugs in water is investigated in a series of papers and in the current work. The free energy of solvation, DeltaG*(vl), of a drug molecule in its pure drug melt at 673.15 K (400 degrees C) has been obtained for 46 drug molecules using the free energy perturbation method. The simulations were performed in two steps where first the Coulomb and then the Lennard-Jones interactions were scaled down from full to no interaction. The results have been interpreted using a theory assuming that DeltaG*(vl) = DeltaG(cav) + E(LJ) + E(C)/2 where the free energy of cavity formation, DeltaG(cav), in these pure drug systems was obtained using hard body theories, and E(LJ) and E(C) are the Lennard-Jones and Coulomb interaction energies, respectively, of one molecule with the other ones. Since the main parameter in hard body theories is the volume fraction, an equation of state approach was used to estimate the molecular volume. Promising results were obtained using a theory for hard oblates, in which the oblate axial ratio was calculated from the molecular surface area and volume obtained from simulations. The Coulomb term, E(C)/2, is half of the Coulomb energy in accord with linear response, which showed good agreement with our simulation results. In comparison with our previous results on free energy of hydration, the Coulomb interactions in pure drug systems are weaker, and the van der Waals interactions play a more important role.},

  Abstract                 = {The solubility of drugs in water is investigated in a series of papers. In this work, we address the process of bringing a drug molecule from the vapor into a pure drug amorphous phase. This step enables us to actually calculate the solubility of amorphous drugs in water. In our general approach, we, on one hand, perform rigorous free energy simulations using a combination of the free energy perturbation and thermodynamic integration methods. On the other hand, we develop an approximate theory containing parameters that are easily accessible from conventional Monte Carlo simulations, thereby reducing the computation time significantly. In the theory for solvation, we assume that DeltaG* = DeltaGcav + ELJ + EC/2, where the free energy of cavity formation, DeltaGcav, in pure drug systems is obtained using a theory for hard-oblate spheroids, and ELJ and EC are the Lennard-Jones and Coulomb interaction energies between the chosen molecule and the others in the fluid. The theoretical predictions for the free energy of solvation in pure amorphous matter are in good agreement with free energy simulation data for 46 different drug molecules. These results together with our previous studies support our theoretical approach. By using our previous data for the free energy of hydration, we compute the total free energy change of bringing a molecule from the amorphous phase into water. We obtain good agreement between the theory and simulations. It should be noted that to obtain accurate results for the total process, high precision data are needed for the individual subprocesses. Finally, for eight different substances, we compare the experimental amorphous and crystalline solubility in water with the results obtained by the proposed theory with reasonable success.},

  Abstract                 = {In view of the extreme importance of reliable computational prediction of aqueous drug solubility, we have established a Monte Carlo simulation procedure which appears, in principle, to yield reliable solubilities even for complex drug molecules. A theory based on judicious application of linear response and mean field approximations has been found to reproduce the computationally demanding free energy determinations by simulation while at the same time offering mechanistic insight. The focus here is on the suitability of the model of both drug and solvent, i.e., the force fields. The optimized potentials for liquid simulations all atom (OPLS-AA) force field, either intact or combined with partial charges determined either by semiempirical AM1/CM1A calculations or taken from the condensed-phase optimized molecular potentials for atomistic simulation studies (COMPASS) force field has been used. The results illustrate the crucial role of the force field in determining drug solubilities. The errors in interaction energies obtained by the simple force fields tested here are still found to be too large for our purpose but if a component of this error is systematic and readily removed by empirical adjustment the results are significantly improved. In fact, consistent use of the OPLS-AA Lennard-Jones force field parameters with partial charges from the COMPASS force field will in this way produce good predictions of amorphous drug solubility within 1 day on a standard desktop PC. This is shown here by the results of extensive new simulations for a total of 47 drug molecules which were also improved by increasing the water box in the hydration simulations from 500 to 2000 water molecules.},

  Abstract                 = {Evidence implicating differential gene expression as a significant driver of evolutionary novelty continues to accumulate, but our understanding of the underlying sources of variation in expression, both environmental and genetic, is wanting. Heritability in particular may be underestimated when inferred from genetic mapping studies, the predominant ``genetical genomics'' approach to the study of expression variation. Such uncertainty represents a fundamental limitation to testing for adaptive evolution at the transcriptomic level. By studying the inheritance of expression levels in 10,495 genes (10,527 splice variants) in a threespine stickleback pedigree consisting of 563 individuals, half of which were subjected to a thermal treatment, we show that 74--98\% of transcripts exhibit significant additive genetic variance. Dominance variance is also prevalent (41--99\% of transcripts), and genetic sources of variation seem to play a more significant role in expression variance in the liver than a key environmental variable, temperature. Among-population comparisons suggest that the majority of differential expression in the liver is likely due to neutral divergence; however, we also show that signatures of directional selection may be more prevalent than those of stabilizing selection. This predominantly aligns with the neutral model of evolution for gene expression but also suggests that natural selection may still act on transcriptional variation in the wild. As genetic variation both within- and among-populations ultimately defines adaptive potential, these results indicate that broad adaptive potential may be found within the transcriptome.},

  Abstract                 = {A comprehensive thermodynamic model has been developed for calculating phase equilibria and speciation in aqueous mixtures containing neutralizing amines and corresponding amine hydrochlorides. The model has been designed to simulate the behavior of refinery overhead environments, in which the presence of amines in combination with hydrogen chloride may lead to the formation of potentially corrosive solid or concentrated aqueous amine hydrochloride phases. For this purpose, the previously developed Mixed-Solvent Electrolyte (MSE) model has been extended to calculate simultaneously solid-gas, solid-liquid, and vapor-liquid equilibria, liquid-phase chemical equilibria, and caloric properties. In the model, standard-state properties of individual species are calculated from the Helgeson-Kirkham-Flowers equation of state whereas the excess Gibbs energy includes a long-range electrostatic interaction term expressed by a Pitzer-Debye-H??ckel equation, a virial coefficient-type term for interactions between ions and a short-range term for interactions involving neutral molecules. This framework accurately represents the properties of systems that range from weak electrolytes, such as amine - water mixtures, to strong electrolytes such as amine hydrochloride - water solutions. For amine hydrochlorides, the model is applicable up to the limit of solid or fused liquid hydrochloride phases. Model parameters have been developed for methylamine, morpholine, N-methylmorpholine, N-ethylmorpholine and their hydrochlorides. The model offers the possibility of understanding the formation of amine hydrochlorides in multicomponent mixtures containing amines, water, hydrogen chloride, and carbon dioxide.},

The present ``simulated scaling'' method is developed with a Wang-Landau type of updating scheme in order to quickly flatten the distributions in the scaling parameter lambdam space. This proposal is meaningful for a broad range of biophysical problems, in which localized sampling is required. Besides its superior capability and robustness in localized conformational sampling, this simulated scaling method can also naturally lead to efficient ``alchemical'' free energy predictions when dual-topology alchemical hybrid potential is applied; thereby simultaneously, both of the chemically and conformationally distinct portions of two end point chemical states can be efficiently sampled. As demonstrated in this work, the present method is also feasible for the quantum mechanical and quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical simulations.},

  Abstract                 = {An approach is developed in the replica exchange framework to enhance conformational sampling for the quantum mechanical (QM) potential based molecular dynamics simulations. Importantly, with our enhanced sampling treatment, a decent convergence for electronic structure self-consistent-field calculation is robustly guaranteed, which is made possible in our replica exchange design by avoiding direct structure exchanges between the QM-related replicas and the activated (scaled by low scaling parameters or treated with high ``effective temperatures'') molecular mechanical (MM) replicas. Although the present approach represents one of the early efforts in the enhanced sampling developments specifically for quantum mechanical potentials, the QM-based simulations treated with the present technique can possess the similar sampling efficiency to the MM based simulations treated with the Hamiltonian replica exchange method (HREM). In the present paper, by combining this sampling method with one of our recent developments (the dual-topology alchemical HREM approach), we also introduce a method for the sampling enhanced QM-based free energy calculations.},

These are promising tools for lead optimization in drug discovery, computing changes in binding free energy due to modifications of a lead compound. However, in the “alchemical” framework for RBFE calculations, some types of mutations have the potential to introduce error into the computed binding free energies. Here we explore the magnitude of this error in several different model binding calculations. We find that some of the calculations involving ring breaking have significant errors, and these errors are especially large in bridged ring systems. Since the error is a function of ligand strain, which is unpredictable in advance, we believe that ring breaking should be avoided when possible. },

Ligands are automatically parametrized with AM1-BCC, and atom mappings for a single topology description are computed with a maximum common substructure search (MCSS) algorithm. An abstract molecular dynamics (MD) engine can be used for equilibration prior to free energy setup or standalone. Currently, all modern AMBER force fields are supported. Ease of use, robustness of the code, and automation where it is feasible are the main development goals. The project follows an open development model, and we welcome contributions.},

  Abstract                 = {A challenge in free energy calculation for complex molecular systems by computer simulation is to obtain a reliable estimate within feasible computational time. In this study, we suggest an answer to this challenge by exploring a simple method, overlap sampling (OS), for producing reliable free-energy results in an efficient way. The formalism of the OS method is based on ensuring sampling of important overlapping phase space during perturbation calculations. This technique samples both forward and reverse free energy perturbation (FEP) to improve the free-energy calculation. It considers the asymmetry of the FEP calculation and features an ability to optimize both the precision and the accuracy of the measurement without affecting the simulation process itself. The OS method is tested at two optimization levels: no optimization (simple OS), and full optimization (equivalent to Bennett's method), and compared to conventional FEP techniques, including the widely used direct FEP averaging method, on three alchemical mutation systems: (a) an anion transformation in water solution, (b) mutation between methanol and ethane, and (c) alchemical change of an adenosine molecule. It is consistently shown that the reliability of free-energy estimates can be greatly improved using the OS techniques at both optimization levels, while the performance of Bennett's method is particularly striking. In addition, the efficiency of a calculation can be significantly improved because the method is able to (a) converge to the right answer quickly, and (b) work for large perturbations. The basic two-stage OS method can be extended to admit additional stages, if needed. We suggest that the OS method can be used as a general perturbation technique for computing free energy differences in molecular simulations. {\copyright} 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  Abstract                 = {Entropy and enthalpy compensation are frequently observed in thermodynamic measurements. To understand the molecular details of these compensating changes, molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo methods may, in principle, be used. Yet, in practice, computational methods to evaluate changes in entropy and enthalpy usually have much greater (e.g. order of magnitude worse) error than relative free energy calculations. In this paper, we examine ways to improve the computational ability to determine changes in both enthalpy and entropy. Toward that end we consider five different perturbation schemes for enthalpy determination and also consider the relative importance of staging the computation (i.e., dividing the entire perturbation calculation into a series of consecutive smaller ones) along the reaction coordinate. Two model systems are used for evaluation: a system of Lennard-Jones spheres, where the computation is directed to the addition/deletion of a sphere, and the alchemical transformation of an anion in explicit TIP3P water from one type to another. The results show only subtle differences among the better perturbation methods and much larger improvement in relative accuracy with the use and careful selection of staged intermediates along the reaction coordinate. As a result of these calculations, we suggest that approximate calculations of relative entropy be used to guide the staging of intermediates for computation of free energy, entropy, and enthalpy differences. We suggest that for these purposes the single state perturbation (SSP) method is the best choice. For the pure purpose of enthalpy and/or entropy evaluation, we suggest multistage SSP and direct approach, respectively, for systems with small and large differences.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider the accuracy of several methods for combining forward and reverse free-energyperturbation averages for two systems (labeled 0 and 1). The practice of direct averaging of these measurements is argued as not reliable. Instead, methods are considered of the form $\beta(A_1 - A_0) = -\ln[ \langle w(u) \exp (\beta u/2)\rangle_0 /\langle w(u) \exp (+\beta u/2)\rangle_1]$, where A is the free energy, $\beta = 1 / kT$ is the reciprocal temperature, $u = U_1 - U_0$ is the difference in configurational energy, $w(u)$ is a weighting function, and the angle brackets indicate an ensemble average performed on the system indicated by the subscript. Choices are considered in which $w(u) = 1$ and $1 / \cosh [(u - C)/2]$; the latter being Bennett's method where $C$ is a parameter that can be selected arbitrarily, and may be used to optimize the precision of the calculation. We examine the methods in several applications: calculation of the pressure of a square-well fluid by perturbing the volume, the chemical potential of a high-density Lennard-Jones system, and the chemical potential of a model for water. We find that the approaches based on Bennett's method weighting are very effective at ensuring an accurate result (one in which the systematic error arising from inadequate sampling is less than the estimated confidence limits), and that even the selection $w(u) = 1$ offers marked improvement over comparable methods. We suggest that Bennett's method is underappreciated, and the benefits it offers for improved precision and (especially) accuracy are substantial, and therefore it should be more widely used.},

  Abstract                 = { Due to the higher computational cost relative to pure molecular mechanical (MM) simulations, hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) free energy simulations particularly require a careful consideration of balancing computational cost and accuracy. Here, we review several recent developments in free energy methods most relevant to QM/MM simulations and discuss several topics motivated by these developments using simple but informative examples that involve processes in water. For chemical reactions, we highlight the value of invoking enhanced sampling technique (e.g. replica-exchange) in umbrella sampling calculations and the value of including collective environmental variables (e.g. hydration level) in metadynamics simulations; we also illustrate the sensitivity of string calculations, especially free energy along the path, to various parameters in the computation. Alchemical free energy simulations with a specific thermodynamic cycle are used to probe the effect of including the first solvation shell into the QM region when computing solvation free energies. For cases where high-level QM/MM potential functions are needed, we analyse two different approaches: the QM/MM–MFEP method of Yang and co-workers and perturbative correction to low-level QM/MM free energy results. For the examples analysed here, both approaches seem productive although care needs to be exercised when analysing the perturbative corrections. },

  Abstract                 = {Natural transformation is a major mechanism of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and plays an essential role in bacterial adaptation, evolution, and speciation. Although its molecular underpinnings have been increasingly revealed, natural transformation is not well characterized in terms of its quantitative ecological roles. Here, by using Neisseria gonorrhoeae as an example, we developed a population-dynamic model for natural transformation and analyzed its dynamic characteristics with nonlinear tools and simulations. Our study showed that bacteria capable of natural transformation can display distinct population behaviors ranging from extinction to coexistence and to bistability, depending on their HGT rate and selection coefficient. With the model, we also illustrated the roles of environmental DNA sources---active secretion and passive release---in impacting population dynamics. Additionally, by constructing and utilizing a stochastic version of the model, we examined how noise shapes the steady and dynamic behaviors of the system. Notably, we found that distinct waiting time statistics for HGT events, namely a power-law distribution, an exponential distribution, and a mix of the both, are associated with the dynamics in the regimes of extinction, coexistence, and bistability accordingly. This work offers a quantitative illustration of natural transformation by revealing its complex population dynamics and associated characteristics, therefore advancing our ecological understanding of natural transformation as well as HGT in general.},

This paper analyzes biomimetically reconstructed coupled autocatalytic cycles as the basis of ancestral metabolic systems. The mechanism for natural selection and evolution in autocatalytic chemical systems may be affected by natural homeostatic parameters such as ambient chemical potentials, temperature, and pressure. Competition between separate parts of an autocatalytic network with positive-plus-negative feedback resulted in the formation of primordial autotrophic, mixotrophic, and heterotrophic metabolic systems. This work examined the last common ancestor of a set of coupled metabolic cycles in a population of protocells. Physical-chemical properties of these cycles determined the main principles of natural selection for the ancestral Bacteria and Archaea taxa.},

  Abstract                 = {Computer-aided drug design (CADD) techniques can be very effective in reducing costs and speeding up drug discovery. The determination of binding and solvation free energies is pivotal for this process and is, therefore, the subject of many studies. In this work, the solvation free energy change (ΔΔGsolv) for a total of 92 transformations in small molecules was predicted using Thermodynamic Integration (TI). It was our aim to compare experimental and calculated solvation free energies for typical and prime additions considered in drug optimizations, analyzing trends, and optimizing a TI protocol. The results showed a good agreement between experimental and predicted values, with an overestimation of the predicted values for CH3, halogens, and NH2, as well as an underestimation for CONH2, but all fall within $\pm$1 kcal/mol. NO2 addition showed a larger and systematic underestimation of the predicted ΔΔGsolv, indicating the need for special attention in these cases. For small molecules, if no experimental data is available, using TI as a theoretical strategy thus appears to be a suitable choice in CADD. It provides a good compromise between time and accuracy.},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce a novel approach to compute dissociation free energy and entropy values in simulations that employ a density functional theory description of the acidic moiety and of the solvent. The approach consists of utilizing an alchemical transformation of a weak acid A-COOH into the strong acid B-COOH, which makes it practical to employ alchemical free energy perturbation methods in the context of ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. The present alchemical transformation circumvents the need to tackle changes in the total number of electrons and atoms by replacing the chemical residue responsible for the change in acidity with an easily tunable external effective potential. Our investigation demonstrates that (1) a simple but effective class of external potentials that control acidity changes in the acetic/trifluoroacetic acid series can be achieved by replacing the methyl and trifluoromethyl substituents by screened dipoles. Using this dipole-field/quantum-mechanics (DF/QM) approach one can predict gas-phase geometries, proton dissociation energies, total dipole moments, and water binding energies in good agreement with full-QM values. (2) The resulting alchemical perturbation calculations are stable and well converged and allow one to compute absolute pK(a) values whose accuracy is limited primarily by the exchange-correlation functional employed: H-COOH=2.5+/-0.6 (full-QM calculation), 3.7 (exp); F(3)C-COOH=0.4+/-0.6 (DF/QM calculation), 0.5 (exp); H(3)C-COOH=3.1+/-0.7 (DF/QM calculation), 4.7 (exp); 3) Our DF/QM model predicts that the difference in acidity between H-COOH and H(3)C-COOH is dominated by solvent entropy effects, in excellent agreement with experimental observations. The calculated difference between the dissociation energies of these acids is DeltaDelta(d)U=0.0+/-0.26 kcal/mol while the experimental value is 0.0+/-0.1 kcal/mol.},

The former quantity is calculated using Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo simulations using either Kohn-Sham density functional theory or a molecular mechanics force field to determine the system's potential energy. The latter Gibbs free energy contribution is computed using a continuum solvation model utilizing either experimental reference data or micro-solvated clusters.

The protocol relies on a dual-topology paradigm, a softening of the intermolecular interactions, and a constraint that prevents the perturbed molecules from drifting away from each other at the end states. The equivalence and the performance of the methodology against a single-topology approach are demonstrated on a pair of harmonic oscillators, the calculation of the relative solvation free energy of ethane and methanol, and the relative binding free energy of two congeneric inhibitors of cyclooxygenase 2. The stability of two alternative binding modes of an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 is then investigated. Finally, the relative binding free energy of two structurally different inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 is calculated. The proposed methodology allows the study of a range of problems that are beyond the reach of traditional relative free energy calculation protocols and should prove useful in drug design studies. },

  Abstract                 = {The difference between free energy changes occurring at two chemical states can be rigorously estimated via alchemical free energy (AFE) simulations. Traditionally, most AFE simulations are carried out under the classical energy potential treatment; then, accuracy and applicability of AFE simulations are limited. In the present work, we integrate a recent second-order generalized ensemble strategy, the orthogonal space random walk (OSRW) method, into the combined quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) potential based AFE simulation scheme. Thereby, within a commonly affordable simulation length, accurate QM/MM alchemical free energy simulations can be achieved. As revealed by the model study on the equilibrium of a tautomerization process of hydrated 3-hydroxypyrazole and by the model calculations of the redox potentials of two flavin derivatives, lumichrome (LC) and riboflavin (RF) in aqueous solution, the present OSRW-based scheme could be a viable path toward the realization of practically efficient QM/MM AFE simulations.},

Limits to selection were generally reached by generation 100. Intermediate selection plateaus were found, with minor genes, for all three modes of opposing natural selection, but they were least frequent with underdominance. Multiple outcomes were common. In particular, fixation of the genotype favored by artificial selection was often associated with fixation of another genotype and/or with a central equilibrium; the end point actually reached depended on the genetic starting point of the simulation. In general, when the alleles favored by truncation selection were combined (positive linkage disequilibrium) in the base population, or when the trait was determined by major genes, artificial selection would prevail. Limitations inherent to this type of work are discussed, and possible avenues for further work on the antagonism between artificial and natural selection are proposed.},

  Abstract                 = {Molecular simulations see widespread and increasing use in computation and molecular design, especially within the area of molecular simulations applied to biomolecular binding and interactions, our focus here. However, force field accuracy remains a concern for many practitioners, and it is often not clear what level of accuracy is really needed for payoffs in a discovery setting. Here, I argue that despite limitations of today's force fields, current simulation tools and force fields now provide the potential for real benefits in a variety of applications. However, these same tools also provide irreproducible results which are often poorly interpreted. Continued progress in the field requires more honesty in assessment and care in evaluation of simulation results, especially with respect to convergence.},

  Abstract                 = {We study the solvation of polar molecules in water. The center of water's dipole moment is offset from its steric center. In common water models, the Lennard-Jones center is closer to the negatively charged oxygen than to the positively charged hydrogens. This asymmetry of water's charge sites leads to different hydration free energies of positive versus negative ions of the same size. Here, we explore these hydration effects for some hypothetical neutral solutes, and two real solutes, with molecular dynamics simulations using several different water models. We find that, like ions, polar solutes are solvated differently in water depending on the sign of the partial charges. Solutes having a large negative charge balancing diffuse positive charges are preferentially solvated relative to those having a large positive charge balancing diffuse negative charges. Asymmetries in hydration free energies can be as large as 10 kcal/mol for neutral benzene-sized solutes. These asymmetries are mainly enthalpic, arising primarily from the first solvation shell water structure. Such effects are not readily captured by implicit solvent models, which respond symmetrically with respect to charge.},

This differs from previous studies in that (1) this was a blind test (in an event called SAMPL sponsored by OpenEye Software) and (2) the test compounds were considerably more challenging than have been used in the past in typical solvation tests of all-atom models. Overall, we found good correlations with experimental values which were subsequently made available, but the variances are large compared to those in previous tests. We tested several different charge models and found that several standard charge models performed relatively well. We found that hypervalent sulfur and phosphorus compounds are not well handled using current force field parameters and suggest several other possible systematic errors. Overall, blind tests like these appear to provide significant opportunities for improving force fields and solvent models.},

  Abstract                 = {In molecular simulations with fixed-charge force fields, the choice of partial atomic charges influences numerous computed physical properties, including binding free energies. Many molecular mechanics force fields specify how nonbonded parameters should be determined, but various choices are often available for how these charges are to be determined for arbitrary small molecules. Here, we compute hydration free energies for a set of 44 small, neutral molecules in two different explicit water models (TIP3P and TIP4P-Ew) to examine the influence of charge model on agreement with experiment. Using the AMBER GAFF force field for nonbonded parameters, we test several different methods for obtaining partial atomic charges, including two fast methods exploiting semiempirical quantum calculations and methods deriving charges from the electrostatic potentials computed with several different levels of ab initio quantum calculations with and without a continuum reaction field treatment of solvent. We find that the best charge sets give a root-mean-square error from experiment of roughly 1 kcal/mol. Surprisingly, agreement with experimental hydration free energies does not increase substantially with increasing level of quantum theory, even when the quantum calculations are performed with a reaction field treatment to better model the aqueous phase. We also find that the semiempirical AM1-BCC method for computing charges works almost as well as any of the more computationally expensive ab initio methods and that the root-mean-square error reported here is similar to that for implicit solvent models reported in the literature. Further, we find that the discrepancy with experimental hydration free energies grows substantially with the polarity of the compound, as does its variation across theory levels.},

  Abstract                 = {Computational techniques see widespread use in pharmaceutical drug discovery, but typically prove unreliable in predicting trends in protein-ligand binding. Alchemical free energy calculations seek to change that by providing rigorous binding free energies from molecular simulations. Given adequate sampling and an accurate enough force field, these techniques yield accurate free energy estimates. Recent innovations in alchemical techniques have sparked a resurgence of interest in these calculations. Still, many obstacles stand in the way of their routine application in a drug discovery context, including the one we focus on here, sampling. Sampling of binding modes poses a particular challenge as binding modes are often separated by large energy barriers, leading to slow transitions. Binding modes are difficult to predict, and in some cases multiple binding modes may contribute to binding. In view of these hurdles, we present a framework for dealing carefully with uncertainty in binding mode or conformation in the context of free energy calculations. With careful sampling, free energy techniques show considerable promise for aiding drug discovery.},

  Abstract                 = {Here, we give an overview of the small molecule hydration portion of the SAMPL4 challenge, which focused on predicting hydration free energies for a series of 47 small molecules. These gas-to-water transfer free energies have in the past proven a valuable test of a variety of computational methods and force fields. Here, in contrast to some previous SAMPL challenges, we find a relatively wide range of methods perform quite well on this test set, with RMS errors in the 1.2 kcal/mol range for several of the best performing methods. Top-performers included a quantum mechanical approach with continuum solvent models and functional group corrections, alchemical molecular dynamics simulations with a classical all-atom force field, and a single-conformation Poisson-Boltzmann approach. While 1.2 kcal/mol is still a significant error, experimental hydration free energies covered a range of nearly 20 kcal/mol, so methods typically showed substantial predictive power. Here, a substantial new focus was on evaluation of error estimates, as predicting when a computational prediction is reliable versus unreliable has considerable practical value. We found, however, that in many cases errors are substantially underestimated, and that typically little effort has been invested in estimating likely error.

  Abstract                 = {The Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo (GEMC) method is a versatile approach for the prediction of fluid phase equilibria from particle-based simulations. For a one-component system, a GEMC simulation utilises two separate simulation boxes for the vapour and the liquid phases and a significant fraction of the computational effort is expended on special trial moves that transfer (swap) particles and exchange volume between the two boxes. The user needs to specify the frequency of swap and volume moves and the overall volume that controls the phase ratio. In this study, the efficiency of GEMC simulation protocols that yield three different frequencies of accepted swap and volume moves and three different phase ratios is assessed for the computation of the saturated vapour pressure and liquid density of n-octane and water at three reduced temperatures. Differences in the simulation efficiency of up to an order of magnitude are observed, and recommendations are made for suitable GEMC simulation protocols.},

  Abstract                 = {The energy landscape used by nature over evolutionary timescales to select protein sequences is essentially the same as the one that folds these sequences into functioning proteins, sometimes in microseconds. We show that genomic data, physical coarse-grained free energy functions, and family-specific information theoretic models can be combined to give consistent estimates of energy landscape characteristics of natural proteins. One such characteristic is the effective temperature Tsel at which these foldable sequences have been selected in sequence space by evolution. Tsel quantifies the importance of folded-state energetics and structural specificity for molecular evolution. Across all protein families studied, our estimates for Tsel are well below the experimental folding temperatures, indicating that the energy landscapes of natural foldable proteins are strongly funneled toward the native state.},

The second part is devoted to designing and improving the main columns i.e., the absorber and the stripper. The third part reviews previous research aiming at designing or optimizing the whole sweetening unit. The last part briefly discusses computational chemistry techniques used by chemists and chemical engineers to design novel solvents at the molecular level.

  Abstract                 = {We extend our previous linear basis function approach for alchemical free energy calculations to the insertion and deletion of charged particles in dense fluids. We compute a near optimal statistical path to introduce Coulombic interactions into various molecules in solution and find that this near optimal path is only marginally more efficient than simple linear coupling of electrostatics in all cases where a repulsive core is already present. We also explore the order in which nonbonded forces are coupled to the environment in alchemical transformations. We test two sets of Lennard-Jones basis functions, a Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA) and a 12-6 decomposition of the repulsive and attractive forces turned on in sequence along with changes in charge, to determine a statistically optimized order in which forces should be coupled. The WCA decomposition has lower statistical uncertainty as coupling the attractive r(-6) basis function contributes non-negligible statistical error. In all cases, the charge should be coupled only after the repulsive core is fully coupled, and the WCA attractive portion can be coupled at any stage without significantly changing the efficiency. The statistical uncertainty of two of the basis function approaches with charged particles is nearly identical to the soft core approach for decoupling electrostatics, though the correlation times for sampling are often longer for a soft core electrostatics approach than the basis function approach. The basis function approach for introducing or removing molecules or functional groups thus represents a useful alternative to the soft core approach with a number of clear computational advantages.},

  Abstract                 = {Experimental data on the transfer of small molecules between vacuum and water are relatively sparse. This makes it difficult to assess whether computational methods are truly predictive of this important quantity or merely good at explaining what has been seen. To explore this, a prospective test was performed of two different methods for estimating solvation free energies: an implicit solvent approach based on the Poisson-Boltzmann equation and an explicit solvent approach using alchemical free energy calculations. For a set of 17 small molecules, root mean square errors from experiment were between 1.3 and 2.6 kcal/mol, with the explicit solvent free energy approach yielding somewhat greater accuracy but at greater computational expense. Insights from outliers and suggestions for future prospective challenges of this kind are presented.},

  Abstract                 = {Classical molecular dynamics simulations are used to compute the solvation free energy of two pharmaceutical solids, namely ibuprofen and acetaminophen in carbon dioxide (CO2), over the density range of interest in supercritical processes. In order to examine the influence of the solvent model on the resulting free energies, three popular CO2 models (Zhang, EPM2, and TraPPE) are studied. Relatively large discrepancies for the solvation free energy exist between these CO2 models, suggesting that the former is sensitive to the different balances between dispersive and electrostatic forces used in these models. In particular, for the solvation of the highly polar (dipole moment of ∼5.2 Debye) acetaminophen molecule, such discrepancies are more pronounced than for the moderately polar ibuprofen (dipole moment of ∼1.6 D) molecule. Since there is an exponential relationship between the solvation free energy and solubility, the choice of the solvent model substantially affects the predicted solubility. For the solubility of the studied solutes, the value obtained using the TraPPE model is the highest, that of the EPM2 model is intermediate, and that of the Zhang model is the lowest. Generally, the simulations results show that the model with the largest quadrupole moment leads to a more negative solvation free energy and a higher solubility over the entire density range. Further, the decomposition of the solvation free energy into contributions stemming from electrostatics and dispersion interactions shows that the electrostatic interactions are important for a quantitative prediction of solid solubility, while the Lennard--Jones parameters of the solute and solvent are more important for qualitative agreement. Additionally, the infinite-dilution partial molar volume of the two solutes is estimated from the pressure derivative of the solvation free energies. With density increasing beyond the value corresponding to the zero partial molar volume of the solute (minimum solvation free energy), the repulsive part of Lennard--Jones potential wins over the attractive interactions, and the solvent strength of supercritical CO2 decreases; however, due to the increase in the chemical potential of the pure solid (effect of the Poynting correction), the solubility further increases. Overall, these results demonstrate the importance of a proper choice of quadrupole moment of the solvent model, which is crucial for quantitative predictions of the solid solubility in supercritical CO2.},

The derivation is based on a stochastic path integral technique that reweights paths at different temperatures. Stochastic dynamics generated by either a Langevin equation or a Metropolis Monte Carlo scheme are treated. The approach enables the entropy-energy decomposition from trajectories evolving at a single-temperature and does not require simulations or measurements at two or more temperatures. Both finite difference and analytical formulae are derived. Testing is performed on a prototypical model system and the method is compared with existing thermodynamic integration and thermodynamic perturbation approaches for entropy-energy decomposition. The new formulae are also put in the context of more general, dynamics-independent expressions that derive from either a fluctuation theorem or the Feynman-Kac theorem.},

Three methods of calculating free energies of solvation were compared: free energy perturbation (FEP), thermodynamic integration (TI) and Bennett acceptance ratio (BAR) method. The solubility constants were estimated based on the obtained free energies and were compared to the previously reported values. We found that free energy differences obtained using the three applied methods agreed very well. For both MEG and DEG the estimated solubility constants were within the same order of magnitude as previously reported solubility constants and therefore in good agreement. The estimated solubility constants of TEG were found to be about an order of magnitude smaller than the lowest reported value, and would still yield a reasonable estimate of residual chemical potential due to the logarithmic dependence.},

  Abstract                 = {Successive parameterizations of the GROMOS force field have been used successfully to simulate biomolecular systems over a long period of time. The continuing expansion of computational power with time makes it possible to compute ever more properties for an increasing variety of molecular systems with greater precision. This has led to recurrent parameterizations of the GROMOS force field all aimed at achieving better agreement with experimental data. Here we report the results of the latest, extensive reparameterization of the GROMOS force field. In contrast to the parameterization of other biomolecular force fields, this parameterization of the GROMOS force field is based primarily on reproducing the free enthalpies of hydration and apolar solvation for a range of compounds. This approach was chosen because the relative free enthalpy of solvation between polar and apolar environments is a key property in many biomolecular processes of interest, such as protein folding, biomolecular association, membrane formation, and transport over membranes. The newest parameter sets, 53A5 and 53A6, were optimized by first fitting to reproduce the thermodynamic properties of pure liquids of a range of small polar molecules and the solvation free enthalpies of amino acid analogs in cyclohexane (53A5). The partial charges were then adjusted to reproduce the hydration free enthalpies in water (53A6). Both parameter sets are fully documented, and the differences between these and previous parameter sets are discussed. {\copyright} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Comput Chem 25: 1656--1676, 2004},

  Abstract                 = {We present a general framework to predict the excess solubility of small molecular solids (such as pharmaceutical solids) in binary solvents via molecular simulation free energy calculations at infinite dilution with conventional molecular models. The present study used molecular dynamics with the General AMBER Force Field to predict the excess solubility of acetanilide, acetaminophen, phenacetin, benzocaine, and caffeine in binary water/ethanol solvents. The simulations are able to predict the existence of solubility enhancement and the results are in good agreement with available experimental data. The accuracy of the predictions in addition to the generality of the method suggests that molecular simulations may be a valuable design tool for solvent selection in drug development processes.},

An overview of techniques to determine entropy differences is given, and the accuracy and convergence behavior of five methods based on thermodynamic integration and perturbation techniques was evaluated using liquid water as a test system. Reasonably accurate entropy differences are obtained through thermodynamic integration in which many copies of a solute are desolvated. When only one solute molecule is involved, only two methods seem to yield useful results, the calculation of solute-solvent entropy through thermodynamic integration, and the calculation of solvation entropy through the temperature derivative of the corresponding free-energy difference. One-step perturbation methods seem unsuitable to obtain entropy estimates.},

  Abstract                 = {We estimate the global minimum variance path for computing the free energy insertion into or deletion of small molecules from a dense fluid. We perform this optimization over all pair potentials, irrespective of functional form, using functional optimization with a two-body approximation for the radial distribution function. Surprisingly, the optimal pairwise path obtained via this method is almost identical to the path obtained using a optimized generalized ``soft core'' potential reported by Pham and Shirts [J. Chem. Phys. 135, 034114 (2011)]10.1063/1.3607597. We also derive the lowest variance non-pairwise potential path for molecular insertion or deletion and compare its efficiency to the pairwise path. Under certain conditions, non-pairwise pathways can reduce the total variance by up to 60\% compared to optimal pairwise pathways. However, optimal non-pairwise pathways do not appear generally feasible for practical free energy calculations because an accurate estimate of the free energy, the parameter that is itself is desired, is required for constructing this non-pairwise path. Additionally, simulations at most intermediate states of these non-pairwise paths have significantly longer correlation times, often exceeding standard simulation lengths for solvation of bulky molecules. The findings suggest that the previously obtained soft core pathway is the lowest variance pathway for molecular insertion or deletion in practice. The findings also demonstrate the utility of functional optimization for determining the efficiency of thermodynamic processes performed with molecular simulation.},

  Abstract                 = {Improving the efficiency of free energy calculations is important for many biological and materials design applications, such as protein-ligand binding affinities in drug design, partitioning between immiscible liquids, and determining molecular association in soft materials. We show that for any pair potential, moderately accurate estimation of the radial distribution function for a solute molecule is sufficient to accurately estimate the statistical variance of a sampling along a free energy pathway. This allows inexpensive analytical identification of low statistical error free energy pathways. We employ a variety of methods to estimate the radial distribution function (RDF) and find that the computationally cheap two-body ``dilute gas'' limit performs as well or better than 3D--RISM theory and other approximations for identifying low variance free energy pathways. With a RDF estimate in hand, we can search for pairwise interaction potentials that produce low variance. We give an example of a search minimizing statistical variance of solvation free energy over the entire parameter space of a generalized ``soft core'' potential. The free energy pathway arising from this optimization procedure has lower curvature in the variance and reduces the total variance by at least 50\% compared to the traditional soft core solvation pathway. We also demonstrate that this optimized pathway allows free energies to be estimated with fewer intermediate states due to its low curvature. This free energy variance optimization technique is generalizable to solvation in any homogeneous fluid and for any type of pairwise potential and can be performed in minutes to hours, depending on the method used to estimate g(r).},

  Abstract                 = {One of the long-standing problems in free energy calculations that involve the annihilation of particles is the choice of how to scale the non-bonded interactions of the disappearing particle. We make use of a ``null transformation'' (converting naphthalene to naphthalene) to extensively test and compare a number of scaling approaches, including simple linear, quadratic, mixed non-linear and separation-shifted (``soft-core'') scaling. While any protocol that involves some sort of non-linear scaling yields reasonable free energy results, only the ``soft-core'' scaling methods yield completely stable dynamics near the simulation end-points. Additional advantages of this method in the context of complex molecular conversions are also discussed.},

  Abstract                 = { As access to computational resources continues to increase, free-energy calculations have emerged as a powerful tool that can play a predictive role in a wide range of research areas. Yet, the reliability of these calculations can often be improved significantly if a number of precepts, or good practices, are followed. Although the theory upon which these good practices rely has largely been known for many years, it is often overlooked or simply ignored. In other cases, the theoretical developments are too recent for their potential to be fully grasped and merged into popular platforms for the computation of free-energy differences. In this contribution, the current best practices for carrying out free-energy calculations using free energy perturbation and nonequilibrium work methods are discussed, demonstrating that at little to no additional cost, free-energy estimates could be markedly improved and bounded by meaningful error estimates. Monitoring the probability distributions that underlie the transformation between the states of interest, performing the calculation bidirectionally, stratifying the reaction pathway, and choosing the most appropriate paradigms and algorithms for transforming between states offer significant gains in both accuracy and precision. },

The free energy agrees well with predictions from scaled-particle theory and the experimental surface tension is predicted to within 5%.

We examined the sensitivity of computed binding free energies to the ligand's electrostatic and van der Waals parameters. Dielectric screening and cancellation of effects between ligand-protein and ligand-solvent interactions reduce the parameter sensitivity of binding affinity by 65\%, compared with interaction strengths computed in the gas-phase. However, multiple changes to parameters combine additively on average, which can lead to large changes in overall affinity from many small changes to parameters. Using these results, we estimate that random, uncorrelated errors in force field nonbonded parameters must be smaller than 0.02 e per charge, 0.06 {\textbackslash}AA per radius, and 0.01 kcal/mol per well depth in order to obtain 68\% (one standard deviation) confidence that a computed affinity for a moderately-sized lead compound will fall within 1 kcal/mol of the true affinity, if these are the only sources of error considered.},

Here, we describe a new ``separated topologies'' method, which computes relative binding free energies using orientational restraints and which has several advantages over existing methods. While standard approaches maintain the initial and final ligand in a shared orientation, the separated topologies approach allows the initial and final ligands to have distinct orientations. This avoids a slowly converging reorientation step in the calculation. The separated topologies approach can also be applied to determine the relative free energies of multiple orientations of the same ligand. We illustrate the approach by calculating the relative binding free energies of two compounds to an engineered site in Cytochrome C Peroxidase.},

  Abstract                 = {The calculation of a protein-ligand binding free energy based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations generally relies on a thermodynamic cycle in which the ligand is alchemically inserted into the system, both in the solvated protein and free in solution. The corresponding ligand-insertion free energies are typically calculated in nanoscale computational boxes simulated under periodic boundary conditions and considering electrostatic interactions defined by a periodic lattice-sum. This is distinct from the ideal bulk situation of a system of macroscopic size simulated under non-periodic boundary conditions with Coulombic electrostatic interactions. This discrepancy results in finite-size effects, which affect primarily the charging component of the insertion free energy, are dependent on the box size, and can be large when the ligand bears a net charge, especially if the protein is charged as well. This article investigates finite-size effects on calculated charging free energies using as a test case the binding of the ligand 2-amino-5-methylthiazole (net charge +1 e) to a mutant form of yeast cytochrome c peroxidase in water. Considering different charge isoforms of the protein (net charges -5, 0, +3, or +9 e), either in the absence or the presence of neutralizing counter-ions, and sizes of the cubic computational box (edges ranging from 7.42 to 11.02 nm), the potentially large magnitude of finite-size effects on the raw charging free energies (up to 17.1 kJ mol(-1)) is demonstrated. Two correction schemes are then proposed to eliminate these effects, a numerical and an analytical one. Both schemes are based on a continuum-electrostatics analysis and require performing Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) calculations on the protein-ligand system. While the numerical scheme requires PB calculations under both non-periodic and periodic boundary conditions, the latter at the box size considered in the MD simulations, the analytical scheme only requires three non-periodic PB calculations for a given system, its dependence on the box size being analytical. The latter scheme also provides insight into the physical origin of the finite-size effects. These two schemes also encompass a correction for discrete solvent effects that persists even in the limit of infinite box sizes. Application of either scheme essentially eliminates the size dependence of the corrected charging free energies (maximal deviation of 1.5 kJ mol(-1)). Because it is simple to apply, the analytical correction scheme offers a general solution to the problem of finite-size effects in free-energy calculations involving charged solutes, as encountered in calculations concerning, e.g., protein-ligand binding, biomolecular association, residue mutation, pKa and redox potential estimation, substrate transformation, solvation, and solvent-solvent partitioning.},

  Abstract                 = {Small molecule distribution coefficients between immiscible nonaqueuous and aqueous phases---such as cyclohexane and water--- the degree to which small molecules prefer one phase over another at a given pH. As distribution coefficients capture both thermodynamic effects (the free energy of transfer between phases) and chemical effects (protonation state and tautomer effects in aqueous solution), they provide an exacting test of the thermodynamic and chemical accuracy of physical models without the long correlation times inherent to the prediction of more complex properties of relevance to drug discovery, such as protein-ligand binding affinities. For the SAMPL5 challenge, we carried out a blind prediction exercise in which participants were tasked with the prediction of distribution coefficients to assess its potential as a new route for the evaluation and systematic improvement of predictive physical models. These measurements are typically performed for octanol-water, but we opted to utilize cyclohexane for the nonpolar phase. Cyclohexane was suggested to avoid issues with the high water content and persistent heterogeneous structure of water- saturated octanol phases, since it has which has greatly reduced water content and a homogeneous liquid structure. Using a modified shake-flask LC-MS/MS protocol, we collected cyclohexane/water distribution coefficients for a set of 53 druglike compounds at pH 7.4. These measurements were used as the basis for the SAMPL5 Distribution Coefficient Challenge, where 18 research groups predicted these measurements before the experimental values reported here were released. In this work, we describe the experimental protocol we utilized for measurement of cyclohexane-water distribution coefficients, report the measured data, propose a new bootstrap-based data analysis procedure to incorporate multiple sources of experimental error, and provide insights to help guide future iterations of this valuable exercise in predictive modeling.},

  Abstract                 = {The ab initio/classical free energy perturbation (ABC-FEP) method proposed previously by Wood [J. Chem. Phys. 110, 1329 (1999)] uses classical simulations to calculate solvation free energies within an empirical potential model, then applies free energy perturbation theory to determine the effect of changing the empirical solute-solvent interactions to corresponding interactions calculated from ab initio methods. This approach allows accurate calculation of solvation free energies using an atomistic description of the solvent and solute, with interactions calculated from first principles. Results can be obtained at a feasible computational cost without making use of approximations such as a continuum solvent or an empirical cavity formation energy. As such, the method can be used far from ambient conditions, where the empirical parameters needed for approximate theories of solvation may not be available. The sources of error in the ABC-FEP method are the approximations in the ab initio method, the finite sample of configurations, and the classical solvent model. This article explores the accuracy of various approximations used in the ABC-FEP method by comparing to the experimentally well-known free energy of hydration of water at two state points (ambient conditions, and 973.15 K and 600 kg/m(3)). The TIP4P-FQ model [J. Chem. Phys. 101, 6141 (1994)] is found to be a reliable solvent model for use with this method, even at supercritical conditions. Results depend strongly on the ab initio method used: a gradient- corrected density functional theory is not adequate, but a localized MP2 method yields excellent agreement with experiment. Computational costs are reduced by using a cluster approximation, in which ab initio pair interaction energies are calculated between the solute and up to 60 solvent molecules, while multi-body interactions are calculated with only a small cluster (5 to 12 solvent molecules). Sampling errors for the ab initio contribution to solvation free energies are +/- 2 kJ/mol or less when 50-200 configurations are used. Using the largest clusters and most accurate ab initio methods, ABC-FEP predicts hydration free energies of water at both state points that agree with equations of state, within the sampling error. These results are the first calculation of a free energy of solvation at extreme conditions from a fully atomistic model with ab initio methods. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics.

  Abstract                 = {The solubility of two ionic salts, namely, KF and NaCl, in water has been calculated by Monte Carlo molecular simulation. Water has been modeled with the extended simple point charge model (SPC/E), ions with the Tosi-Fumi model and the interaction between water and ions with the Smith-Dang model. The chemical potential of the solute in the solution has been computed as the derivative of the total free energy with respect to the number of solute particles. The chemical potential of the solute in the solid phase has been calculated by thermodynamic integration to an Einstein crystal. The solubility of the salt has been calculated as the concentration at which the chemical potential of the salt in the solution becomes identical to that of the pure solid. The methodology used in this work has been tested by reproducing the results for the solubility of KF determined previously by Ferrario et al. [J. Chem. Phys.117, 4947 (2002)]. For KF, it was found that the solubility of the model is only in qualitative agreement with experiment. The variation of the solubility with temperature for KF has also been studied. For NaCl, the potential model used predicts a solubility in good agreement with the experimental value. The same is true for the hydration chemical potential at infinite dilution. Given the practical importance of solutions of NaCl in water the model used in this work, whereas simple, can be of interest for future studies.},

  Abstract                 = {An expanding repertoire of ``allosteric'' drugs is revealing that structure-based drug design (SBDD) is not restricted to the ``active site'' of the target protein. Such compounds have been shown to bind distant regions of the protein topography, potentially providing higher levels of target specificity, reduced toxicity and access to new regions of chemical space. Unfortunately, the location of such allosteric pockets is not obvious in the absence of a bound crystal structure and the ability to predict their presence would be useful in the discovery of novel therapies. Here, we describe a method for the prediction of ``druggable'' binding sites that takes protein flexibility into account through the use of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. By using a dynamic representation of the target, we are able to sample multiple protein conformations that may expose new drug-binding surfaces. We perform a fragment-based mapping analysis of individual structures in the MD ensemble using the FTMAP algorithm and then rank the most prolific probe-binding protein residues to determine potential ``hot-spots'' for further examination. This approach has recently been applied to a pair of human G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), resulting in the detection of five potential allosteric sites.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a new estimator for computing free energy differences and thermodynamic expectations as well as their uncertainties from samples obtained from multiple equilibrium states via either simulation or experiment. The estimator, which we call the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio estimator (MBAR) because it reduces to the Bennett acceptance ratio estimator (BAR) when only two states are considered, has significant advantages over multiple histogram reweighting methods for combining data from multiple states. It does not require the sampled energy range to be discretized to produce histograms, eliminating bias due to energy binning and significantly reducing the time complexity of computing a solution to the estimating equations in many cases. Additionally, an estimate of the statistical uncertainty is provided for all estimated quantities. In the large sample limit, MBAR is unbiased and has the lowest variance of any known estimator for making use of equilibrium data collected from multiple states. We illustrate this method by producing a highly precise estimate of the potential of mean force for a DNA hairpin system, combining data from multiple optical tweezer measurements under constant force bias.},

All conversions were fully automated from the originally prepared AMBER input files using a combination of the ParmEd and InterMol conversion programs. We find that the energy calculations for all molecular dynamics engines for this molecular set agree to better than 0.1 {\%} relative absolute energy for all energy components, and in most cases an order of magnitude better, when reasonable choices are made for different cutoff parameters. However, there are some surprising sources of statistically significant differences. Most importantly, different choices of Coulomb's constant between programs are one of the largest sources of discrepancies in energies. We discuss the measures required to get good agreement in the energies for equivalent starting configurations between the simulation programs, and the energy differences that occur when simulations are run with program-specific default simulation parameter values. Finally, we discuss what was required to automate this conversion and comparison.},

  Abstract                 = {In an alchemical transformation, a chemical species is transformed into another via a pathway of nonphysical (alchemical) states. Many physical processes, such as ligand binding or transfer of a molecule from gas to solvent, can be equivalently expressed as a composition of such alchemical transformations. Often, these alchemical processes are much more amenable to computational simulation than the physical process itself, especially in complex biochemical systems. A relative ligand-binding affinity, for example, may be computed via a thermodynamic cycle by alchemically transforming one ligand to another both bound to a receptor and in solution. There are other successful nonalchemical approaches for the computation of free energy differences, such as phase equilibrium Monte Carlo methods for modeling multicomponent fluids and potential of mean force methods. Alchemical approaches, however, generally allow for the larger range of conformational complexity typical of biochemical systems. This chapter discusses the efficiency and convergence of free energy methods rather than on accuracy, which is a function of the force field.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent work has demonstrated the Bennett acceptance ratio method is the best asymptotically unbiased method for determining the equilibrium free energy between two end states given work distributions collected from either equilibrium and nonequilibrium data. However, it is still not clear what the practical advantage of this acceptance ratio method is over other common methods in atomistic simulations. In this study, we first review theoretical estimates of the bias and variance of exponential averaging (EXP), thermodynamic integration (TI), and the Bennett acceptance ratio (BAR). In the process, we present a new simple scheme for computing the variance and bias of many estimators, and demonstrate the connections between BAR and the weighted histogram analysis method. Next, a series of analytically solvable toy problems is examined to shed more light on the relative performance in terms of the bias and efficiency of these three methods. Interestingly, it is impossible to conclusively identify a ``best'' method for calculating the free energy, as each of the three methods performs more efficiently than the others in at least one situation examined in these toy problems. Finally, sample problems of the insertion/deletion of both a Lennard-Jones particle and a much larger molecule in TIP3P water are examined by these three methods. In all tests of atomistic systems, free energies obtained with BAR have significantly lower bias and smaller variance than when using EXP or TI, especially when the overlap in phase space between end states is small. For example, BAR can extract as much information from multiple fast, far-from-equilibrium simulations as from fewer simulations near equilibrium, which EXP cannot. Although TI and sometimes even EXP can be somewhat more efficient in idealized toy problems, in the realistic atomistic situations tested in this paper, BAR is significantly more efficient than all other methods.},

In order to examine the accuracy of a range of common water models used for protein simulation for their solute∕solvent properties, we calculate the free energy of hydration of 15 amino acid side chain analogs derived from the OPLS-AA parameter set with the TIP3P, TIP4P, SPC, SPC∕E, TIP3P-MOD, and TIP4P-Ew water models. We achieve a high degree of statistical precision in our simulations, obtaining uncertainties for the free energy of hydration of 0.02 -- 0.06 kcal ∕ mol , equivalent to that obtained in experimental hydration free energy measurements of the same molecules. We find that TIP3P-MOD, a model designed to give improved free energy of hydration for methane, gives uniformly the closest match to experiment; we also find that the ability to accurately model pure water properties does not necessarily predict ability to predict solute∕solvent behavior. We also evaluate the free energies of a number of novel modifications of TIP3P designed as a proof of concept that it is possible to obtain much better solute∕solvent free energetic behavior without substantially negatively affecting pure water properties. We decrease the average error to zero while reducing the root mean square error below that of any of the published water models, with measured liquid water properties remaining almost constant with respect to our perturbations. This demonstrates there is still both room for improvement within current fixed-charge biomolecular force fields and significant parameter flexibility to make these improvements. Recent research in computational efficiency of free energy methods allows us to perform simulations on a local cluster that previously required large scale distributed computing, performing four times as much computational work in approximately a tenth of the computer time as a similar study a year ago.},

In order to examine the accuracy of a range of common models used for protein simulation, we calculate the free energy of hydration of 15 amino acid side chain analogs derived from recent versions of the OPLS-AA, CHARMM, and AMBER parameter sets in TIP3P water using thermodynamic integration. We achieve a high degree of statistical precision in our simulations, obtaining uncertainties for the free energy of hydration of 0.02--0.05 kcal/mol, which are in general an order of magnitude smaller than those found in other studies. Notably, this level of precision is comparable to that obtained in experimental hydration free energy measurements of the same molecules. Root mean square differences from experiment over the set of molecules examined using AMBER-, CHARMM-, and OPLS-AA-derived parameters were 1.35 kcal/mol, 1.31 kcal/mol, and 0.85 kcal/mol, respectively. Under the simulation conditions used, these force fields tend to uniformly underestimate solubility of all the side chain analogs. The relative free energies of hydration between amino acid side chain analogs were closer to experiment but still exhibited significant deviations. Although extensive computational resources may be needed for large numbers of molecules, sufficient computational resources to calculate precise free energy calculations for small molecules are accessible to most researchers.},

  Abstract                 = {The accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding free energies is a primary objective in computer-aided drug design. The solvation free energy of a small molecule provides a surrogate to the desolvation of the ligand in the thermodynamic process of protein-ligand binding. Here, we use explicit solvent molecular dynamics free energy perturbation to predict the absolute solvation free energies of a set of 239 small molecules, spanning diverse chemical functional groups commonly found in drugs and drug-like molecules. We also compare the performance of absolute solvation free energies obtained using the OPLS\_2005 force field with two other commonly used small molecule force fieldssgeneral AMBER force field (GAFF) with AM1-BCC charges and CHARMm-MSI with CHelpG charges. Using the OPLS\_2005 force field, we obtain high correlation with experimental solvation free energies (R2 ) 0.94) and low average unsigned errors for a majority of the functional groups compared to AM1-BCC/GAFF or CHelpG/CHARMm- MSI. However, OPLS\_2005 has errors of over 1.3 kcal/mol for certain classes of polar compounds. We show that predictions on these compound classes can be improved by using a semiempirical charge assignment method with an implicit bond charge correction},

  Abstract                 = { The energetic consequences of amino acid substitutions were investigated using molecular dynamics free energy simulations (MD/FES). A focus of the present study is how one can treat some of the intrinsic problems associated with the use of dummy atoms, which are introduced in standard MD/FES procedures working with a constant number of particles. Specifically, we show how one can introduce dummy atoms, which retain all the covalent interactions, in a “hybrid residue”, in such a way that the influence of the bonded interactions with dummy atoms do not influence the final free energy change. The simulations thus can be done using a transformation protocol in which all covalent bond contributions are maintained invariant throughout the calculations; only the nonbonded interactions are varied. That is, the number of atoms is maintained constant by introducing dummy atoms, which are covalently linked to the protein in question, but which have no nonbonded interactions at one or the other of the two end point reference states. The potential energy function describing the transformation was constructed such that all internal energy terms are invariant with respect to the thermodynamic coupling parameter λ (0 ≤ λ ≤ 1). This simulation procedure therefore has similarities with both the “single topology” and “dual topology” methods, which have been used in other investigations. This transformation and MD/FES strategy was evaluated using three different systems, in which an Ala is transformed into a Val (the italicized residues were transformed): formyl-Ala-ethanolamine; formyl-(Ala)3-Ala-Ala-Ala-(Ala)3-ethanolamine (as an α-helix); and formyl-(Ala)3-Val-Ala-Val-(Ala)3-ethanolamine (as an α-helix). The calculations examined how the free energy difference associated with an Ala-to-Val transformation depends on the choice of transformation path, the equilibration time, and the number windows used in the calculation. The results show that MD/FES provides for stable energy estimates for any intermediate state, as defined by the coupling parameter λ, including the end point reference states:  λ = 0 and λ = 1. With an appropriate choice of sigmoid transformation path, free energy changes with minimal variability and good reversibility were obtained for all three systems using MD/FES lasting longer than 2.4 ns. },

Infinite dilution activity coefficients are calculated by pure simulation and simulations used in combination with experimental vapour--pressures. The activity coefficients are then used to fit the parameters in Wilson's equation thereby giving overall predictions of activity. Results are compared with free energies and activity coefficients based on experimental values.

We apply the new approach to the binding of a series of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) protease inhibitors to examine the effect ensemble reranking has on relative accuracy as well as to evaluate the role of the absolute and relative ligand configurational entropy losses upon binding in affinity differences for structurally related inhibitors. Our results suggest that most thermodynamic parameters can be estimated using only a small fraction of the full configurational space, and we see significant improvement in relative accuracy when using an ensemble versus single-conformer approach to ligand ranking. We also find that using approximate metrics based on the single-conformation enthalpy differences between the global minimum energy configuration in the bound as well as unbound states also correlates well with experiment. Using a novel, additive entropy expansion based on conditional mutual information, we also analyze the source of ligand configurational entropy loss upon binding in terms of both uncoupled per degree of freedom losses as well as changes in coupling between inhibitor degrees of freedom. We estimate entropic free energy losses of approximately +24 kcal/mol, 12 kcal/mol of which stems from loss of translational and rotational entropy. Coupling effects contribute only a small fraction to the overall entropy change (1-2 kcal/mol) but suggest differences in how inhibitor dihedral angles couple to each other in the bound versus unbound states. The importance of accounting for flexibility in drug optimization and design is also discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Electrostatic free energies play an essential role in numerous biomolecular processes occurring in solution. Difficulties arise when the long-range Coulomb interaction is computed for idealised infinite simulation models with periodic boundary conditions. To maintain a neutral simulation box and a finite per-box energy, a neutralising charge density or `gellium' is commonly used, leading to a mean box potential that is constrained to be rigorously equal to zero at all times. Thus, in considering quantities such as ion solvation free energy, the potential drop to move from solvent into the usual, gas phase reference state is missing. In fact, for an infinite molecular system, the electrostatic potential itself is not uniquely defined, but takes the form of an infinite series that is only conditionally convergent. This leads to several possible computational conventions that give different values for the potential and field, all mathematically valid. For experimentally measurable quantities, however, unique results are obtained when sufficiently large simulation boxes are utilised. These concepts are detailed, as well as a fundamental, linear response theoretical framework that provides qualitative understanding of the physical processes involved, especially dielectric relaxation of the environment in response to a new solute charge. Illustrative applications to ligand binding and biomolecular electron transfer are described.},

  Abstract                 = {Hydrophobic interactions are investigated by molecular dynamics computer simulations of the free energy, entropy, and internal energy of association of two methane molecules in water. Recently we reported a computer simulation calculation of the entropy of association of methane in water [J. Am. Chem. Soc. 114, 5875 (1992)], where entropy drives nonpolar solutes together at short distances. Here this method is compared with two other general methods for the calculation of the entropic contribution to the free energy. The calculated thermodynamic quantities for methane association are in good agreement with available experimental measurements. Solute contact configurations are found to be of greater importance than solvent‐separated configurations, in conflict with earlier theoretical and simulation studies of similar systems. In some cases, this conflict may be understood in terms of differences in the assumed, model intermolecular potential energies.},

  Abstract                 = {Molecular dynamics-based free energy calculations allow the determination of a variety of thermodynamic quantities from computer simulations of small molecules. Thermodynamic integration (TI) calculations can suffer from instabilities during the creation or annihilation of particles. This ``singularity'' problem can be addressed with ``soft-core'' potential functions which keep pairwise interaction energies finite for all configurations and provide smooth free energy curves. ``One-step'' transformations, in which electrostatic and van der Waals forces are simultaneously modified, can be simpler and less expensive than ``two-step'' transformations in which these properties are changed in separate calculations. Here, we study solvation free energies for molecules of different hydrophobicity using both models. We provide recommended values for the two parameters (LJ) and (C) controlling the behavior of the soft-core Lennard-Jones and Coulomb potentials and compare one- and two-step transformations with regard to their suitability for numerical integration. For many types of transformations, the one-step procedure offers a convenient and accurate approach to free energy estimates.},

In this study we compare the performance of linear and several nonlinear transformation methods, among them separation shifted ``soft core'' scaling, for a popular test system, the hydration free energy of an amino acid side chain. All the nonlinear methods yield similar results if extensive sampling is performed, but soft core scaling provides smooth λ curves that are best suited for commonly used numerical integration schemes. Additionally, results from a more flexible solute, hexane, will also be discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {In the conventional classical density functional theory (DFT) for simple fluids, an ideal gas is usually chosen as the reference system because there is a one-to-one correspondence between the external field and the density distribution function, and the exact intrinsic free-energy functional is available for the ideal gas. In this case, the second-order density functional Taylor series expansion of the excess intrinsic free-energy functional provides the hypernetted-chain (HNC) approximation. Recently, it has been shown that the HNC approximation significantly overestimates the solvation free energy (SFE) for an infinitely dilute Lennard-Jones (LJ) solution, especially when the solute particles are several times larger than the solvent particles [T. Miyata and J. Thapa, Chem. Phys. Lett. 604, 122 (2014)]. In the present study, we propose a reference-modified density functional theory as a systematic approach to improve the SFE functional as well as the pair distribution functions. The second-order density functional Taylor series expansion for the excess part of the intrinsic free-energy functional in which a hard-sphere fluid is introduced as the reference system instead of an ideal gas is applied to the LJ pure and infinitely dilute solution systems and is proved to remarkably improve the drawbacks of the HNC approximation. Furthermore, the third-order density functional expansion approximation in which a factorization approximation is applied to the triplet direct correlation function is examined for the LJ systems. We also show that the third-order contribution can yield further refinements for both the pair distribution function and the excess chemical potential for the pure LJ liquids.},

  Abstract                 = {Atmospheric aerosols generally comprise a mixture of electrolytes, organic compounds, and water. Determining the gas--particle distribution of volatile compounds, including water, requires equilibrium or mass transfer calculations, at the heart of which are models for the activity coefficients of the particle-phase components. We evaluate here the performance of four recent activity coefficient models developed for electrolyte/organic/water mixtures typical of atmospheric aerosols. Two of the models, the CSB model [Clegg, S.L., Seinfeld, J.H., Brimblecombe, P., 2001. Thermodynamic modelling of aqueous aerosols containing electrolytes and dissolved organic compounds. Journal of Aerosol Science 32, 713--738] and the aerosol diameter dependent equilibrium model (ADDEM) [Topping, D.O., McFiggans, G.B., Coe, H., 2005. A curved multi-component aerosol hygroscopicity model framework: part 2---including organic compounds. Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics 5, 1223--1242] treat ion--water and organic--water interactions but do not include ion--organic interactions; these can be referred to as ``decoupled'' models. The other two models, reparameterized Ming and Russell model 2005 [Raatikainen, T., Laaksonen, A., 2005. Application of several activity coefficient models to water--organic--electrolyte aerosols of atmospheric interest. Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics 5, 2475--2495] and X-UNIFAC.3 [Erdakos, G.B., Change, E.I., Pandow, J.F., Seinfeld, J.H., 2006. Prediction of activity coefficients in liquid aerosol particles containing organic compounds, dissolved inorganic salts, and water---Part 3: Organic compounds, water, and ionic constituents by consideration of short-, mid-, and long-range effects using X-UNIFAC.3. Atmospheric Environment 40, 6437--6452], include ion--organic interactions; these are referred to as ``coupled'' models. We address the question---Does the inclusion of a treatment of ion--organic interactions substantially improve the performance of the coupled models over that of the decoupled models? Performance is judged by the extent to which each model is able to reproduce experimental water activity data for mixtures of organic acids (malonic, succinic, glutaric, citric, maleic, and malic acids) and inorganic electrolytes (NaCl and (NH4)2SO4). It is found, based on the comparisons reported here, that the decoupled models perform as well as, and in some cases better than, the coupled models. Since such activity coefficient models are likely to continue to be developed in the future and because we consider here only a limited set of organic compounds, the current study should be viewed as an interim assessment. The scarcity of experimental data for mixtures of atmospheric relevance remains a limitation for testing activity coefficient models.},

Action potentials (APs) facilitate rapid responses to the nearly continuous fluctuations in the animal's surroundings.

The linking of the two systems via intracellular Ca2+ networks which address transcription factors -- e.g., cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) -- is an appropriate focus for the biology of human behavior. Computational modeling utilizing Boolean networks (BNs) is a suitable qualitative method, requiring no kinetic information, for eliciting the systems' architectural properties. In particular, BNs can reveal critical intracellular regimes of possible evolutionary significance. As a platform for future research, we propose that those networks sufficiently robust to attenuate damaging intracellular noise and deleterious mutations, yet sufficiently close to chaos to permit or amplify adaptive noise and favorable mutations, would be favored by natural selection. Critical regimes of this type would be, literally, ``poised for survival'', and would stabilize and promote the survival of their correlated cultural phenotypes.},

  Abstract                 = {The potential of mean force between two large parallel hydrophobic oblate ellipsoidal plates in liquid water is determined by molecular dynamics. Each ellipsoid displaces approximately 40 water molecules and has major and minor axes of 3.1 and 9.3 Angstrom, respectively, has a surface area of 650 Angstrom(2), and interacts repulsively with the solvent water molecules. The potential of mean force is calculated from thermodynamic perturbation theory for a series of decreasing plate separations, using constant-pressure molecular dynamics. As the plates are moved together, they are first separated by three water layers and then by two, but for shorter distances, a dewetting transition occurs, and one water layer is never observed despite the fact that one can fit. As the plates are brought together, there is a corresponding weak oscillation in the potential of mean force corresponding to the removal Of each water layer until the dewetting transition takes place, and for closer separations, the surrounding water molecules induce a constant average attractive force of 25 (kJ/mol)/Angstrom between the plates. This hydrophobic attraction is largely entropic in character, and the potential of mean force is found to be proportional to the area of the water-vacuum surface in this dewetting regime. The constant of proportionality is found to be smaller than the gas-liquid surface tension of the water model used. There is a very strong short-range driving force toward contact pairing.},

  Abstract                 = { The presentation of potentially pathogenic peptides by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules is one of the most important processes in adaptive immune defense. Prediction of peptide–MHC (pMHC) binding affinities is therefore a principal objective of theoretical immunology. Machine learning techniques achieve good results if substantial experimental training data are available. Approaches based on structural information become necessary if sufficiently similar training data are unavailable for a specific MHC allele, although they have often been deemed to lack accuracy. In this study, we use a free energy method to rank the binding affinities of 12 diverse peptides bound by a class I MHC molecule HLA-A*02:01. The method is based on enhanced sampling of molecular dynamics calculations in combination with a continuum solvent approximation and includes estimates of the configurational entropy based on either a one or a three trajectory protocol. It produces precise and reproducible free energy estimates which correlate well with experimental measurements. If the results are combined with an amino acid hydrophobicity scale, then an extremely good ranking of peptide binding affinities emerges. Our approach is rapid, robust, and applicable to a wide range of ligand–receptor interactions without further adjustment. },

  Abstract                 = {Differential geometry (DG) based solvation models are a new class of variational implicit solvent approaches that are able to avoid unphysical solvent-solute boundary definitions and associated geometric singularities, and dynamically couple polar and non-polar interactions in a self-consistent framework. Our earlier study indicates that DG based non-polar solvation model outperforms other methods in non-polar solvation energy predictions. However, the DG based full solvation model has not shown its superiority in solvation analysis, due to its difficulty in parametrization, which must ensure the stability of the solution of strongly coupled nonlinear Laplace-Beltrami and Poisson-Boltzmann equations. In this work, we introduce new parameter learning algorithms based on perturbation and convex optimization theories to stabilize the numerical solution and thus achieve an optimal parametrization of the DG based solvation models. An interesting feature of the present DG based solvation model is that it provides accurate solvation free energy predictions for both polar and non-polar molecules in a unified formulation. Extensive numerical experiment demonstrates that the present DG based solvation model delivers some of the most accurate predictions of the solvation free energies for a large number of molecules.},

  Abstract                 = {The absolute (standard) binding free energy of eight FK506-related ligands to FKBP12 is calculated using free energy perturbation molecular dynamics (FEP/MD) simulations with explicit solvent. A number of features are implemented to improve the accuracy and enhance the convergence of the calculations. First, the absolute binding free energy is decomposed into sequential steps during which the ligand-surrounding interactions as well as various biasing potentials restraining the translation, orientation, and conformation of the ligand are turned ``on'' and ``off.'' Second, sampling of the ligand conformation is enforced by a restraining potential based on the root mean-square deviation relative to the bound state conformation. The effect of all the restraining potentials is rigorously unbiased, and it is shown explicitly that the final results are independent of all artificial restraints. Third, the repulsive and dispersive free energy contribution arising from the Lennard-Jones interactions of the ligand with its surrounding (protein and solvent) is calculated using the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen separation. This separation also improves convergence of the FEP/MD calculations. Fourth, to decrease the computational cost, only a small number of atoms in the vicinity of the binding site are simulated explicitly, while all the influence of the remaining atoms is incorporated implicitly using the generalized solvent boundary potential (GSBP) method. With GSBP, the size of the simulated FKBP12/ligand systems is significantly reduced, from approximately 25,000 to 2500. The computations are very efficient and the statistical error is small ( approximately 1 kcal/mol). The calculated binding free energies are generally in good agreement with available experimental data and previous calculations (within approximately 2 kcal/mol). The present results indicate that a strategy based on FEP/MD simulations of a reduced GSBP atomic model sampled with conformational, translational, and orientational restraining potentials can be computationally inexpensive and accurate.},

  Abstract                 = { The accurate prediction of protein–ligand binding free energies remains a significant challenge of central importance in computational biophysics and structure-based drug design. Multiple recent advances including the development of greatly improved protein and ligand molecular mechanics force fields, more efficient enhanced sampling methods, and low-cost powerful GPU computing clusters have enabled accurate and reliable predictions of relative protein–ligand binding free energies through the free energy perturbation (FEP) methods. However, the existing FEP methods can only be used to calculate the relative binding free energies for R-group modifications or single-atom modifications and cannot be used to efficiently evaluate scaffold hopping modifications to a lead molecule. Scaffold hopping or core hopping, a very common design strategy in drug discovery projects, is critical not only in the early stages of a discovery campaign where novel active matter must be identified but also in lead optimization where the resolution of a variety of ADME/Tox problems may require identification of a novel core structure. In this paper, we introduce a method that enables theoretically rigorous, yet computationally tractable, relative protein–ligand binding free energy calculations to be pursued for scaffold hopping modifications. We apply the method to six pharmaceutically interesting cases where diverse types of scaffold hopping modifications were required to identify the drug molecules ultimately sent into the clinic. For these six diverse cases, the predicted binding affinities were in close agreement with experiment, demonstrating the wide applicability and the significant impact Core Hopping FEP may provide in drug discovery projects. },

  Abstract                 = { Designing tight-binding ligands is a primary objective of small-molecule drug discovery. Over the past few decades, free-energy calculations have benefited from improved force fields and sampling algorithms, as well as the advent of low-cost parallel computing. However, it has proven to be challenging to reliably achieve the level of accuracy that would be needed to guide lead optimization (∼5× in binding affinity) for a wide range of ligands and protein targets. Not surprisingly, widespread commercial application of free-energy simulations has been limited due to the lack of large-scale validation coupled with the technical challenges traditionally associated with running these types of calculations. Here, we report an approach that achieves an unprecedented level of accuracy across a broad range of target classes and ligands, with retrospective results encompassing 200 ligands and a wide variety of chemical perturbations, many of which involve significant changes in ligand chemical structures. In addition, we have applied the method in prospective drug discovery projects and found a significant improvement in the quality of the compounds synthesized that have been predicted to be potent. Compounds predicted to be potent by this approach have a substantial reduction in false positives relative to compounds synthesized on the basis of other computational or medicinal chemistry approaches. Furthermore, the results are consistent with those obtained from our retrospective studies, demonstrating the robustness and broad range of applicability of this approach, which can be used to drive decisions in lead optimization. },

The simulations were performed in two steps, where first the Coulomb and then the Lennard-Jones interactions between the solute and the water molecules were scaled down from full to zero strength to provide physical understanding and simpler predictive models. The results have been interpreted using a theory assuming DeltaG*(vw) = A(MS)gamma + E(LJ) + E(C)/2 where A(MS) is the molecular surface area, gamma is the water-vapor surface tension, and E(LJ) and E(C) are the solute-water Lennard-Jones and Coulomb interaction energies, respectively. It was found that by a proper definition of the molecular surface area our results as well as several results from the literature were found to be in quantitative agreement using the macroscopic surface tension of TIP4P water. This is in contrast to the surface tension for water around a spherical cavity that previously has been shown to be dependent on the size of the cavity up to a radius of approximately 1 nm. The step of scaling down the electrostatic interaction can be represented by linear response theory.},

  Abstract                 = {Force field accuracy is still one of the ``stalemates'' in biomolecular modeling. Model systems with high quality experimental data are valuable instruments for the validation and improvement of effective potentials. With respect to protein--ligand binding, organic host--guest complexes have long served as models for both experimental and computational studies because of the abundance of binding affinity data available for such systems. Binding affinity data collected for cyclodextrin (CD) inclusion complexes, a popular model for molecular recognition, is potentially a more reliable resource for tuning energy parameters than hydration free energy measurements. Convergence of binding free energy calculations on CD host--guest systems can also be obtained rapidly, thus offering the opportunity to assess the robustness of these parameters. In this work, we demonstrate how implicit solvent parameters can be developed using binding affinity experimental data and the binding energy distribution analysis method (BEDAM) and validated using the Grid Inhomogeneous Solvation Theory analysis. These new solvation parameters were used to study protein--ligand binding in two drug targets against the HIV-1 virus and improved the agreement between the calculated and the experimental binding affinities. This work illustrates how benchmark sets of high quality experimental binding affinity data and physics-based binding free energy models can be used to evaluate and optimize force fields for protein--ligand systems.},

While observation of such events can promote understanding of binding and unbinding pathways{,} it does not alone provide information about the molecular drivers for protein-ligand association{,} nor guidance on how a ligand could be optimised to better bind to the protein. We have developed the waterswap (C. J. Woods et al.{,} J. Chem. Phys.{,} 2011{,} 134{,} 054114) absolute binding free energy method that calculates binding affinities by exchanging the ligand with an equivalent volume of water. A significant advantage of this method is that the binding free energy is calculated using a single reaction coordinate from a single simulation. This has enabled the development of new visualisations of binding affinities based on free energy decompositions to per-residue and per-water molecule components. These provide a clear picture of which protein-ligand interactions are strong{,} and which active site water molecules are stabilised or destabilised upon binding. Optimisation of the algorithms underlying the decomposition enables near-real-time visualisation{,} allowing these calculations to be used either to provide interactive feedback to a ligand designer{,} or to provide run-time analysis of protein-ligand molecular dynamics simulations.},

  Abstract                 = {The combination of quantum mechanics (QM) with molecular mechanics (MM) offers a route to improved accuracy in the study of biological systems, and there is now significant research effort being spent to develop QM/MM methods that can be applied to the calculation of relative free energies. Currently, the computational expense of the QM part of the calculation means that there is no single method that achieves both efficiency and rigor; either the QM/MM free energy method is rigorous and computationally expensive, or the method introduces efficiency-led assumptions that can lead to errors in the result, or a lack of generality of application. In this paper we demonstrate a combined approach to form a single, efficient, and, in principle, exact QM/MM free energy method. We demonstrate the application of this method by using it to explore the difference in hydration of water and methane. We demonstrate that it is possible to calculate highly converged QM/MM relative free energies at the MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ/OPLS level within just two days of computation, using commodity processors, and show how the method allows consistent, high-quality sampling of complex solvent configurational change, both when perturbing hydrophilic water into hydrophobic methane, and also when moving from a MM Hamiltonian to a QM/MM Hamiltonian. The results demonstrate the validity and power of this methodology, and raise important questions regarding the compatibility of MM and QM/MM forcefields, and offer a potential route to improved compatibility.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider ways to quantify the overlap of the parts of phase space important to two systems, labeled A and B. Of interest is how much of the A-important phase space lies in that important to B, and how much of B lies in A. Two measures are proposed. The first considers four total-energy distributions, formed from all combinations made by tabulating either the A-system or the B-system energy when sampling either the A or B system. Measures for A in B and B in A are given by two overlap integrals defined on pairs of these distributions. The second measure is based on information theory, and defines two relative entropies which are conveniently expressed in terms of the dissipated work for free-energy perturbation (FEP) calculations in the A--{\textbackslash}textgreaterB and B--{\textbackslash}textgreaterA directions, respectively. Phase-space overlap is an important consideration in the performance of free-energy calculations. To demonstrate this connection, we examine bias in FEP calculations applied to a system of independent particles in a harmonic potential. Systems are selected to represent a range of overlap situations, including extreme subset, subset, partial overlap, and nonoverlap. The magnitude and symmetry of the bias (A--{\textbackslash}textgreaterB vs B--{\textbackslash}textgreaterA) are shown to correlate well with the overlap, and consequently with the overlap measures. The relative entropies are used to scale the amount of sampling to obtain a universal bias curve. This result leads to develop a simple heuristic that can be applied to determine whether a work-based free-energy measurement is free of bias. The heuristic is based in part on the measured free energy, but we argue that it is fail-safe inasmuch as any bias in the measurement will not promote a false indication of accuracy.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider staged free-energy calculation methods in the context of phase-space overlap relations, and argue that the selection of work-based methods should be guided by consideration of the phase-space overlap of the systems of interest. Stages should always be constructed such that work is performed only into a system that has a phase-space subset relation with the starting system. Thus multiple stages are required if the systems of interest are not such that one forms a phase-space subset with the other. Three two-stage methods are possible, termed umbrella sampling, overlap sampling, and funnel sampling. The last is appropriate for cases in which the subset relation holds, but only in the extreme, meaning that one system's important phase space constitutes a very small portion of the others. Umbrella sampling is most suitable for nonoverlap systems, and overlap sampling is appropriate for systems exhibiting partial phase-space overlap. We review recently introduced metrics that characterize phase-space overlap, showing that the performance of the single- and two-stage methods is consistent with the phase-space picture. We also demonstrate that a recently introduced bias-detection measure is effective in identifying inaccuracy in single- and multistage calculations. The examples used are the chemical-potential calculation for a Lennard-Jones liquid at moderate and at high densities, the same for model water at ambient conditions, and a process of charging a neutral ion in water.},

The models exhibit the asymmetry that is sometimes seen in these calculations, in which the magnitude of the bias is greater when the calculation is performed in one direction ( A--{\textgreater}B , sampling system A and perturbing into system B ) versus the other (B--{\textgreater}A) . Both models are formulated as a system of N independent particles, each sampling a space in the presence of a one-body field that is different for the A and B systems. In one model the field is a harmonic potential. The other model is discrete, such that each particle can be at one of two points (or states) of different energy. The neglected-tail bias model is applied to each system to estimate the average bias as a function of the amount of FEP sampling, and numerical calculations are performed to show that the bias model is effective. We show that the bias is significantly smaller when sampling is performed on the system having a broader work distribution (we designate this direction ``insertion'') compared to the bias for FEP calculations that sample the system with a narrower distribution (``deletion'').},

  Abstract                 = {To improve the understanding of the condensation of asphaltenes in supercritical water (SCW), the solvation of asphaltenes under SCW environments was investigated with molecular dynamics simulation. The simulation results indicate that the repulsive van der Waals interaction has a primary influence on the nature and the magnitude of the interaction between asphaltenes and SCW. A cavity short-range solvent structure surrounding asphaltenes thus is formed, and the solvation free energy (Gsol) of asphaltenes in SCW has a positive sign in most cases. The scale of cavities and the value of Gsol both are determined mainly by the bulk density of water. By the repulsive asphaltenes/SCW interaction and the attractive π--π aromatic interaction, the aggregation of asphaltenes in SCW occurs spontaneously. The asphaltene clusters formed, containing asphaltene monomers and nanoaggregates, present a coke-like supramolecular structure. Benefiting from excellent diffusivity in SCW, the aggregation of asphaltenes in SCW can be accomplished rapidly.},

A five-descriptor correlation equation, with a squared correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.9655 and a standard error of estimation (s) of 0.613, was produced by using the stepwise multilinear regression analysis on a training set of 35 compounds. The reliability of the proposed model was further illustrated using various evaluation techniques: leave-one-out cross-validation procedure, randomization tests, and validation through an external test set of 10 compounds. All descriptors involved in the model were derived solely from the chemical structure of the compounds, which makes the model very useful in predicting ln(γ∞) of other chlorinated organic compounds not present in the dataset used for the development of the present model. In addition, the descriptors were discussed in detail to understand the interactions that affect infinite dilution activity coefficients.},

  Abstract                 = {The thermodynamic integration (TI) and expanded ensemble (EE) methods are used here to calculate the hydration free energy in water, the solvation free energy in 1-octanol, and the octanol-water partition coefficient for a six compounds of varying functionality using the optimized potentials for liquid simulations (OPLS) all-atom (AA) force field parameters and atomic charges. Both methods use the molecular dynamics algorithm as a primary component of the simulation protocol, and both have found wide applications in fields such as the calculation of activity coefficients, phase behavior, and partition coefficients. Both methods result in solvation free energies and 1-octanol/water partition coefficients with average absolute deviations (AAD) from experimental data to within 4 kJ/mol and 0.5 log units, respectively. Here, we find that in simulations the OPLS-AA force field parameters (with fixed charges) can reproduce solvation free energies of solutes in 1-octanol with AAD of about half that for the solute hydration free energies using a extended simple point charge (SPC/E) model of water. The computational efficiency of the two simulation methods are compared based on the time (in nanoseconds) required to obtain similar standard deviations in the solvation free energies and 1-octanol/water partition coefficients. By this analysis, the EE method is found to be a factor of nine more efficient than the TI algorithm. For both methods, solvation free energy calculations in 1-octanol consume roughly an order of magnitude more CPU hours than the hydration free energy calculations. {\copyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

For a molecular solute, 4πr2p(r) oscillates with the distance r to the solute, and g(r) has a large peak in the near-solute region, as observed in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Herein, the Poisson equation was modified for computing p based on the modified Gauss's law of Maxwell's equations, and the potential of the mean force was used for computing g. For one or two charged atoms in a water cluster, the solvation free energies of the solutes obtained by these equations were similar to those obtained from MD simulations.},

The analysis includes both equilibrium and nonequilibrium approaches, and distinguishes between unidirectional and bidirectional methodologies. We are primarily interested in comparing two recently proposed approaches, adaptive integration, and single-ensemble path sampling to more established methodologies. As test cases, we study relative solvation free energies of large changes to the size or charge of a Lennard-Jones particle in explicit water. The results show that, for the systems used in this study, both adaptive integration and path sampling offer unique advantages over the more traditional approaches. Specifically, adaptive integration is found to provide very precise long-simulation DeltaF estimates as compared to other methods used in this report, while also offering rapid estimation of DeltaF. The results demonstrate that the adaptive integration approach is the best overall method for the systems studied here. The single-ensemble path sampling approach is found to be superior to ordinary Jarzynski averaging for the unidirectional, ``fast-growth'' nonequilibrium case. Closer examination of the path sampling approach on a two-dimensional system suggests it may be the overall method of choice when conformational sampling barriers are high. However, it appears that the free energy landscapes for the systems used in this study have rather modest configurational sampling barriers.},

  Abstract                 = {A promising method for calculating free energy differences DeltaF is to generate nonequilibrium data via ``fast-growth'' simulations or by experiments--and then use Jarzynski's equality. However, a difficulty with using Jarzynski's equality is that DeltaF estimates converge very slowly and unreliably due to the nonlinear nature of the calculation--thus requiring large, costly data sets. The purpose of the work presented here is to determine the best estimate for DeltaF given a (finite) set of work values previously generated by simulation or experiment. Exploiting statistical properties of Jarzynski's equality, we present two fully automated analyses of nonequilibrium data from a toy model, and various simulated molecular systems. Both schemes remove at least several k(B)T of bias from DeltaF estimates, compared to direct application of Jarzynski's equality, for modest sized data sets (100 work values), in all tested systems. Results from one of the new methods suggest that good estimates of DeltaF can be obtained using 5-40-fold less data than was previously possible. Extending previous work, the new results exploit the systematic behavior of bias due to finite sample size. A key innovation is better use of the more statistically reliable information available from the raw data.},

  Abstract                 = {The free energy, energy, and entropy of solvation, relative to the pure liquid, are analyzed. By a coupling parameter integration it is shown that only averages over the solute--solvent interaction energy contribute to the free energy and that the solvent--solvent interaction term, which contributes the so‐called cavity (solvent reorganization) term to the energy, is cancelled exactly by a corresponding term in the entropy. These terms exist even in the infinite dilution limit since they arise from the derivative of the free energy with respect to the solute density. Following the approach of Garisto e t a l. [J. Chem. Phys. 7 9, 6294 (1983)], the site--site Ornstein--Zernike integral equations and HNC closures are used to determine the derivatives of the distribution functions with respect to the density. This makes it possible to calculate the energetic and entropic contributions to the solvation free energy in the infinite dilution limit. The method is applied to pure solvent and to infinitely dilute aqueous solutions of cations, anions and neutral Lennard‐Jones particles. The results are in agreement with numerical calculations of the thermodynamic quantities by use of finite difference values for the temperature derivatives. A simple empirical relation for the charge dependence of the solvation free energy is observed; it is shown for the case of an ion in a dipolar solvent, as typified by aqueous electrolyte solutions, that the free energy of solvation varies quadratically with the charge and is very nearly equal to one‐half the solute--solvent portion of the solvation energy. Some discussion of the relation of the present results to entropy--enthalpy compensation and to computer simulations is given.},

  Abstract                 = {A new method of simultaneously scaling and shifting the Lennard--Jones (LJ) potential in molecular dynamics (MD) and thermodynamic integration (TI) simulations is presented. The approach allows the smooth creation or annihilation of atoms or molecules in an ensemble of solvent molecules during a molecular simulation. By scaling and shifting the LJ potential in the direction of the interatomic distance between particles, the method eliminates the problem of the creation or annihilation of a large repulsive LJ potential at the initial or final state of a TI. The optimal degree of shifting and scaling the LJ potential as a function of a control variable $\lambda$ was studied for the annihilation and creation of neon in aqueous solution. The method was further tested on the calculation of the free energy of aqueous solvation of a small molecule, ethanol. In contrast to linear scaling of the LJ potential during TI, the calculated free energies using the new separation--shifted scaling approach are reasonably well converged after 200--500 ps of simulation and show smaller hysteresis comparing forward and reverse TI.},

  Abstract                 = {In this work the idea was investigated whether calculated hydration energy (ΔGhyd) can be used as a molecular descriptor in defining promising regions of chemical space for drug design. Calculating ΔGhyd using the Density Solvation Model (SMD) in conjunction with the density functional theory (DFT) gave an excellent correlation with experimental values. Furthermore, calculated ΔGhyd correlates reasonably well with experimental water solubility (r2=0.545) and also log P (r2=0.530). Three compound collections were used: Known drugs (n=150), drug-like compounds (n=100) and simple organic compounds (n=140). As an approximation only molecules, which do not de/protonate at physiological pH were considered. A relatively broad distribution was seen for the known drugs with an average at −15.3 kcal/mol and a standard deviation of 7.5 kcal/mol. Interestingly, much lower averages were found for the drug-like compounds (−7.5 kcal/mol) and the simple organic compounds (−3.1 kcal/mol) with tighter distributions; 4.3 and 3.2 kcal/mol, respectively. This trend was not observed for these collections when calculated log P and log S values were used. The considerable greater exothermic ΔGhyd average for the known drugs clearly indicates in order to develop a successful drug candidate value of ΔGhyd{\textless}−5 kcal/mol or less is preferable.},

These three solubility descriptors can be expressed as functions of mechanical properties that are directly observable in the Gibbs ensemble approach, thereby allowing for very precise determination of the descriptors. Additionally, the Henry's law constants of multiple solutes can be computed from a single simulation. Most of the simulations were carried out for systems containing 1,000 solvent and up to 8 solute molecules, and further simulations using either 500 or 2,000 solvent molecules point to negligible system size effects. A comparison with experimental data shows that the united-atom version of the transferable potential for phase equilibria force field yields Henry's law constants that reproduce well the differences between the four solutes and the changes upon increase of the temperature.},

  Abstract                 = {The three-dimensional reference interaction site model (3D-RISM) integral equation is applied to predict the hydration free-energies and solution enthalpies at infinite dilution for amines and alkanolamines. In particular, the closure equation for 3D-RISM is integrated with the bridge functions derived from minimizing the hard-sphere free-energy functional for different interactions. The density distributions of water molecules around different solute molecules are calculated to intuitively describe the solvent effects. The solution enthalpies and hydration free-energies are then determined by the density distributions. Meanwhile, the solution enthalpies for some alkanolamines with low volatility are measured, and the values at infinite dilution are thereby obtained through extrapolation. It is shown that the theoretical predictions are generally in agreement with the experimental results, suggesting that the current theoretical approach is reasonable to quantitatively evaluate the solvent effect of various amine-based CO2 absorbents.},

We now give a more complete presentation of (i) rigorous general bounds on the free energy and other nonlinear averages, which generalize Jensen's inequality; (ii) asymptotic N?8 expansions of the average behavior of the finite-sampling error in ?F estimates; (iii) illustrative examples of large-N behavior, both in free-energy and other calculations; and (iv) the universal, large-N relation between the average finite-sampling error and the fluctuation in the error.
