% BR: I cannot make sense of the rest of the paragraph. Also, you seem to ascribe this method only to AMBER and yet one reference is from me (with CHARMM). 

--> ???


% BR: I do not understand what this means. It sounds very odd. 

Explicit dummy atoms are not needed as the code will 
only compute bonded contributions for ``real'' atoms and thus ignores bonded 
energies involving dummy atoms.  We will call this the ``implicit dummy 
protocol''. 

% BR: Personally, I would not call PERT a dual topology. In fact, it is neither completely dual nor single. It depends on the user.

—> ?

% BR: ARE WE OR NOT ALL USING THE TIP3P with the small LJ on the hydrogens?

—> Check…

%BR: Why is this not called double decoupling rather than double annihilation? 
% Aren't you turning off only the nonbonded interactions, and keeping the intramolecular terms?

—> Should be clarified, decoupling — only INTERMOLECULAR NON BONDED
Annihilation — INTER + SOME INTRA TERMS 



%BR: I think that Table 1 should only report absolute free energy and that we should put all the differences in Table 3 for direct comparison (otherwise I keep jumping from one table to the other...).
% Table 2 should have the following information:
%  Transformation       Absolute free energy             Average volume at lambda=0      Average volume at lambda=1   Average energy at lambda=0    Average energy at lambda=1
%                     AMBER CHARMM GROMACS SOMD          AMBER CHARMM GROMACS SOMD       AMBER CHARMM GROMACS SOMD    AMBER CHARMM GROMACS SOMD     AMBER CHARMM GROMACS SOMD


(Table 2)
%DLM: Would be good to have error bars on those.
—> TODO resample errors with script

% The tables are nice, but a plot would allow one to visualize this immediately.
—> plot?


% HHL: All, please add your data here!
%JM: ask Stefano to add data for SOMD. Convert figures into 
% a histogram plot.
% Guilherme) how did you propagate errors to compute the cycle 
% closure uncertainty?

%DLM: Are we putting this data in? Should be easy to compute the standard error in the bond length averaged over the trajectories to get error bars. I agree with you that it sounds like a very significant and very important difference, but that relies on a priori knowledge you and I have (which is that bonds are very stiff degrees of freedom so the fluctuations in these lengths should be very small) and it would be better to just give the data to show this, especially since we HAVE the data. :) 

—> Would need standard error bond lengths. Remove?
