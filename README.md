# relative-solvation-paper
Paper on reproducibility of relative solvation free energies across packages.

NOTE: this uses LaTeX and requires siunitx.sty (non-standard package!).
Easiest is to use arara to build the PDFs as the .tex files are prepared for
this.  Inkscape will be needed to create the PDFS from the SVG sources.
Also possible to compile with latexmk.
